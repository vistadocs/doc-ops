<h1>The Love Song of J. Random Hacker, 1995</h1>

(Doctah Kurtz, he dead. A GOTO for the old guy.)<p>

Let us go then, you and I,<br>
For fast Chinese and talk of years gone by,<br>
Filled with random jumps and custom cable;<br>
Let us go, recalling joys of FORTH and MUMPS,<br>
The cluttering lumps<br>
Of threaded code in frantic, ten-hour hacks<br>
To get that midterm project off our backs;<br>
With code that twisted, doubled-back and bent<br>
And set into cement<br>
But came through with an underwhelming "B"...<br>
Oh, do not ask, "What was it?"<br>
I don't care what it does, just how it does it.<p>

On BIX the expert systems come and go,<br>
Bragging about how much they know.<p>

Over yellow chad that chattered out from teletype machines,<br>
Over yellow tape that rattled out encoding fever dreams<br>
That curled into the data center trash,<br>
We lingered, inventing novel sort/merge schemes<br>
Or ways to thwart collisions when we hash--<br>
At last we looked up, to the tube's insistent feep,<br>
And, seeing we'd been logged in since late last week,<br>
Took one last slug of Jolt and fell asleep.<p>

On BIX the expert systems come and go,<br>
Bragging about how much they know.<p>

No! I am not Bill Gates, nor would I want to be;<br>
I'd rather parse the fish than own the knife;<br>
(Imagine! Having moby bux but chained<br>
To forty million lusers, what a life...)<br>
Am a flamer, goateed, pallid, overweight,<br>
Willing to pull two shifts, then (hell) a third,<br>
To save a session from a deadlocked state;<br>
At times, (to put it mildly) unrestrained--<br>
Almost, at times, a nerd.<p>

I grow old...I grow old...<br>
dBase II and Wordstar are no longer sold.<p>

Shall I start a BBS? Do I dare to try to teach?<br>
I shall take my palmheld portable and hack upon the beach.<br>
I have heard the networks passing packets, each to each.<p>

They have no traffic for the likes of me.<p>

I have seen the Altair live and die<br>
And software startups score on sorry score--<br>
And millions made by men like Mitch Kapor.<p>

We hackers linger by our leading edge<br>
Forgetting what is pending in the cache<br>
Till practice hurtles past us, and we crash.<br>
