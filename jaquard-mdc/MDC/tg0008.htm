<b>1. Name</b><p>
This Task Group shall be called MDC Task Group 8: Internal
Procedures,
hereafter referred to as the Task Group.<p>

<b>2. Introduction</b><p>
These bylaws are for the purpose of extending and clarifying the
Constitution
of the MUMPS Development Committee; with no intent of conflicting
with or
circumventing it. Therefore, the bylaws are to be interpreted in
the spirit of
the Constitution, and, in the event of apparent conflict, the
bylaws are
submissive to the Constitution.<p>

<b>3. Scope of Work</b><p>

<ol>
<li>Update of Procedure Rules to reflect current status of MDC<p>

<li>Modifications to Constitution to remove repeated wording and
to allow
Subcommittee Chairs to remove task group chairs for lack of
progress,
etcetera.<p>

<li>Investigate possibilities of streamlining changes to
technical
proposals.<p>

<li>Provide procedures for producing corrigenda.<p>

<li>Assist task groups in producing bylaws.<p>
</ol>

This scope of work is not to be misinterpreted as being the
entire scope of
work of the Task Group. New proposals may be introduced at the
pleasure of the
MDC.<p>
