<title>MUMPs for MEMS</title>

Thank you for your email message...<p>

The micromachining community, or more correctly, the Microelectromechanical
Systems (MEMS) community is those of us who use fabrication methods similar to
integrated circuit manufacturing to product systems which combine computation,
sensing and actuation. These systems are produced on the same scale-order as
IC's, allowing the miniaturization of mechanical, optical, fluid, electrical,
etc. systems.<p>

Examples of these that have been written in the popular press recently, include
Analog Device's ADXL-50 airbag accelerometer, Texas Instruments Deformable
Display Device. Micromachining or MEMS has been a skyrocketing technology area
in the past few years, with it's roots back to the 60's and the advent of
"micromachining" of silicon.<p>

Anyway, where MUMPs comes in, is that in 1992 I started a program, with
support from ARPA (or rather DARPA, now) to make advanaced MEMS technology
available to all domestic participants at a very low cost, and low effort. That
is the origina of the <b>M</b>ulti-<b>U</b>ser <b>M</b>EMS
<b>P</b>rocesse<b>s</b> (MUMPs).<p>

We had actually run into your MUMPS community a while back, but as you pointed
out, we realized that we don't run in the same space and figured it would not
be an issue. Wouldn't have been without the web search engines!<p>

We looked at trademarking our use of MUMPs (note the little s), and did go as
far as checking for active registration of that name. We were not able to find
any, so I think it has lapsed. We decided that we really didn't need the
trademark and left it at that.<p>

As I mentioned in my original note, we are known world-wide in the
microfabrication community, even though we only allow (for now) US/Canadian
participation. (That is DOD's doing.) We will be opening up our access to
Europe and the rest of the world in the next 2 years.<p>

So, I hope that better explains who/what our MUMPs is.<p>

Sincerely yours,<p>
