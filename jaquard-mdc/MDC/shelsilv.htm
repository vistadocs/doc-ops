<h3>From Shel Silverstein's <b>Where the Sidewalk Ends</b></h3>

<h4>Sick</h4>

<p>"I cannot go to school today,"<br/>
Said little Peggy Ann McKay.<br/>
"I have the measles and the <b>mumps</b>,<br/>
A gash, a rash and purple bumps.<br/>
My mouth is wet, my throat is dry,<br/>
I'm going blind in my right eye.<br/>
My tonsils are as big as rocks,<br/>
I've counted sixteen chicken pox<br/>
And there's one more &mdash; that's seventeen,<br/>
And don't you think my face looks green?<br/>
My leg is cut, my eyes are blue &mdash;<br/>
It might be instamatic flu.<br/>
I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke,<br/>
I'm sure that my left leg is broke &mdash;<br/>
My hip hurts when I move my chin,<br/>
My belly button's caving in,<br/>
My back is wrenched, my ankle's sprained,<br/>
My 'pendix pains each time it rains.<br/>
My nose is cold, my toes are numb,<br/>
I have a sliver in my thumb.<br/>
My neck is stiff, my spine is weak,<br/>
I hardly whisper when I speak.<br/>
My tongue is filling up my mouth,<br/>
I think my hair is falling out.<br/>
My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight,<br/>
My temperature is one-o-eight.<br/>
My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear,<br/>
There is a hole inside my ear.<br/>
I have a hangnail, and my heart is &mdash; what?<br/>
What's that? What's that you say?<br/>
You say today is... Saturday?<br/>
G'bye, I'm going out to play!"</p>
