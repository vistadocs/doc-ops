<i>Scope of work</i>: <b>X11/93-52</b>, 25 October 1993<p>

Complete the approval of the current MDC standards as ANSI and
ISO standards. The Task Group is
responsible for interacting with ANSI and the canvassees to
ensure the approval of the standards by ANSI. This
task group was originally created in conformance with
X11/90-33.<p>

The following is the remaining work for the Task Group:<p>

<ol>
<li>Submit final documents to ANSI, ANSI canvass list, NIST, and
ISO (for informal review).<p>

<li>Respond to negative comments. If necessary, the Task Group
will meet with the objectors to clarify
objections and discuss possible resolutions. If the objections
are not resolved to the satisfaction of the
objectors, the Task Group will meet with the objectors
<i>again</i> to discuss the disposition of their objections.<p>

Priority will be given to negative comments resulting from the
ANSI canvass.<p>

<li>Make editorial changes as needed.<p>

<li>Refer substantive changes back to the MDC for its
consideration. Unresolved technical objections will
be distributed to the full committee prior to recanvass. The Task
Group will make the following motion
to the committee: <i>Move to withdraw the proposed ANSI standard
(X11.x) from canvass for
reconsideration</i>. A simple majority of the voting membership
us needed to withdraw.<p>

<li>The MDC shall decide whether the document will be withdrawn
or other action be taken. If the document
is to be recanvassed, the document, along with all official ANSI
canvass objections and their
corresponding responses, will be mailed to the entire canvass
list for reconsideration.<p>

<li>Any unresolved technical objections resulting from the
recanvass will be distributed to the full committee.
The Task Group chair will make the following motion to the
