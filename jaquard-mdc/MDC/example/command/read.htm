<title>M[UMPS] Commands</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>R[EAD]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p><tt><b>READ</b> "Please enter your name: ",NAME<br>
<b>WRITE</b> "Please enter your name: " <b>READ</b> NAME</tt><br>
Both lines of code seemingly have the same effect. On some
implementations, the former example has the side-effect to flush
the type-ahead buffer.</p>

<p><tt><b>READ</b> X#20</tt><br>
Read a string of fixed length (do not wait for a terminator).</p>

<p><tt><b>READ</b> X:20</tt><br>
Read a string. When a 'terminator' key is pressed, the
<b>READ</b> command will be satisfied. If, after 20 seconds, no
'terminator' key has been pressed, the <b>READ</b> command will
also be satisfied. In this case, the value returned in <tt>X</tt>
is 'as many characters as have been entered before the time-out
elapsed'.</p>

<p><tt><b>READ</b> *X:20</tt><br>
Read a single character. The value returned in <tt>X</tt> will be
an integer number. If the time-out expires, this value will be
<tt>-1</tt>.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1984 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p><tt><b>READ</b> X#1<br>
<b>READ</b> *X</tt><br>
Both lines of code read one single character. The first line
always returns a string of length 1 in local variable <tt>X</tt>.
The second line returns an integer value in local variable
<tt>X</tt>; although practically all implementations return the
ASCII code of the character processed, the value returned in
local variable <tt>X</tt> is implementation-specific and device
specific and it is not to be considered portable to rely on a
specific value being returned.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p><tt><b>READ</b> ^ABC</tt><br>
It is allowed to read values directly into global variables.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The ability to specify an "output time-out" is added. An output
time-out is specified as a device parameter in an OPEN or USE
command. Examples are shown with the <a href="use.htm">USE 
command</a>.</p>

<p>User-definable I/O handling has been added. When
user-definable I/O handling is active:<br>
<ul>
<li>the command <tt><b>READ</b> variable[#count][:timeout]</tt><br>
will be executed as<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> variable=<b>$$%READ^routine</b>([count],[timeout])</tt></li>
<li>the command <tt><b>READ</b> #</tt><br>
will be executed as<br>
<tt><b>DO %WRITEFF</b>^routine(<b>1</b>)</tt></li>
<li>the command <tt><b>READ</b> !</tt><br>
will be executed as<br>
<tt><b>DO %WRITENL</b>^routine(<b>1</b>)</tt></li>
<li>the command <tt><b>READ</b> ?pos</tt><br>
will be executed as<br>
<tt><b>DO %WRITETAB</b>^routine(pos,<b>1</b>)</tt></li>
<li>the command <tt><b>READ</b> "string"</tt><br>
will be executed as<br>
<tt><b>DO %WRITE</b>^routine("string",<b>1</b>)</tt></li>
<li>the command <tt><b>READ</b> *variable[:timeout]</tt><br>
will be executed as<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> variable=<b>$$%READS</b>^routine(,[timeout])</tt></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Examples with naked references:</p>

<p><b>READ</b> VARIABLE<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,<br>
<b>READ</b> ^(3,4)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,3,</tt><br>
; Actual reference is: <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt></p>
