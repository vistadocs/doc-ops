<title>M[UMPS] Commands</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>O[PEN]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>Clarifications (no change intended) in a future ANSI M[UMPS]
language standard:</p>

<p>When a device is currently "OPEN", and another OPEN command is
issued by the process that "owns" the device, and in the later
OPEN command the device parameters are different than in the
original one, the system will behave as if the device is
virtually CLOSEd and then re-OPENed with the new parameters. If
the new parameters are incompatible with the device, error
processing will occur "as usual".</p>

<p>Any keywords in the argument of the command are processed in 
strict left-to-right order. When multiple equivalent parameters 
are encountered, the last occurrence processed will define the 
action(s) to be taken.</p>

<p>For examples, see the examples with the <b>USE</b> command.</p>

<p>Additions in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The ability to specify "user-defined" <u>mnemonicspace</u>s is added.
It will be possible to specify to an implementation to use entries in a
specific routine (let's call it <tt>USER</tt> for the purpose of this 
discussion) for the processing of the commands <b>OPEN</b>, <b>USE</b>
and <b>CLOSE</b> and the various <u>controlmnemonic</u>s for specific 
combinations of device and <u>mnemonicspace</u>.</p>

<p>When this feature is active, the <u>controlmnemonic</u>
<tt>/ABC(P1,P2)</tt> will be executed as <tt><b>DO</b> 
ABC^USER(P1,P2)</tt>, and the command <tt><b>OPEN</b> 
device:(PARAM1:KEY2=VALUE2)</tt> will be executed as:
<pre>
<b>DO</b>
. <b>NEW</b> X,Y
. <b>SET</b> (X,Y)=2 ; Number of deviceparameters
. <b>SET</b> X(1)="PARAM1" ; First deviceparameter
. <b>SET</b> X(2)="KEY2",Y(2)=VALUE2
. <b>DO</b> %OPEN^USER(device,.X,.Y,"")
. <b>QUIT</b>
</pre>

The name of a device may contain an environment specification<br>
<tt><b>OPEN</b> |"LONDON"|MTA47</tt></p>

<p>The addition of a binding to TCP/IP socket devices includes a
number of new deviceparameters.</p>

<p>The deviceparameters are: ATTACH, CONNECT, DELIMITER, IOERROR,
LISTEN, DETACH and SOCKET.
For examples, see the <a href="use.htm">USE command</a>.</p>

<p>For a program that parses a programming language, it is hard
to see the difference between:<br>
<tt>...:(abc=xyz):...</tt><br>
and<br>
<tt>...:(<b>FILENAME</b>="C:\temp\ABC.TMP"):...</tt><br>
In the former example, the text between the parentheses should be
an expression that happens to return a boolean value, whereas in
the latter example, the text between the parentheses could be a
"keyword equals value" combination that has a meaning in certain
mnemonicspaces.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier to indicate this difference, the
option to precede a devicekeyword with a slash has been
introduced. This would make the latter example look like:<br>
<tt>...:(<b>/FILENAME</b>="C:\temp\ABC.TMP"):...</tt></p>

<p>Examples with naked references:</p>

<p><b>OPEN</b> DEVICE<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,<br>
<b>OPEN</b> ^(3,4)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,3,</tt><br>
; Actual reference is: <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt></p>

<p><b>OPEN</b> DEVICE:PARAMETERS<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,<br>
<b>OPEN</b> ^(3,4):^(5,6)</tt><br>
; 1. fetch ^(3,4) = <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt><br>
; 2. fetch ^(5,6) = <tt>^ABC(1,3,5,6)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,3,5,</tt></p>
