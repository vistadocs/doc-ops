<h2>AUNB[LOCK]</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Language
standard, as a part of the "event
processing" extensions.</p>

<p>This command "un-blocks" an event. When an event is "blocked"
for a process, that process will not be interrupted to process
that event when one occurs. If a registered event occurs for a
process while it is "blocked", it will be queued for later
processing. If an un-registered event occurs while it is
"blocked", it will be ignored. Events are registered by assigning
values to nodes in structured system variable <b>^$JOB</b>. Events are
"blocked" using the command <b>ABLOCK</b>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: every <b>ABLOCK</b> command increases the "block"
counter for an event. In order to "un-block" an event, every
<b>AUNBLOCK</b> command decreases that counter. Events are only
"un-blocked" when the value of that counter is equal to zero.</p>

<p>For examples, see the command <b>ABLOCK</b>.</p>
