<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>TH[EN]</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Language standard.</p>

<p>The command <b>THEN</b> stacks the value of special variable
<b>$TEST</b>. This value will be "popped" off the stack when
execution moves to a different line of code (either through a
<b>GOTO</b> command, or when the end of the current line is reached).</p>

<p>Assume that the code segment below is executed.</p>

<pre>
 <b>FOR</b> A=1,0 <b>DO</b>
 . <b>IF</b> A <b>WRITE</b> !,"TRUE 1" <b>IF</b> 0
 . <b>ELSE  WRITE</b> !,"FALSE 1"
 . <b>IF</b> A <b>THEN  WRITE</b> !,"TRUE 2" <b>IF</b> 0
 . <b>ELSE  WRITE</b> !,"FALSE 2"
 . <b>QUIT</b>
</pre>

<p>At the first iteration of the <b>FOR</b> loop, the value of <tt>A</tt>
is true (1).
The first <b>IF</b> command will cause the text <tt>"TRUE&nbsp;1"</tt>
to be written, and the second <b>IF</b> command on that line will cause
the value of special variable <b>$TEST</b> to be set to 0 (false).
As a result, on the next line, the <b>ELSE</b> command will cause
the text <tt>"FALSE&nbsp;1"</tt> to be written.</p>

<p>The next <b>IF</b> command will cause the text <tt>"TRUE&nbsp;2"</tt>
to be written, and this time, the <b>THEN</b> command will stack
the value of <b>$TEST</b> (which is at this point equal to 1).
After this, the second <b>IF</b> command on that line will cause
the value of special variable <b>$TEST</b> to be set to 0 (false).
At this point, the end of the line is reached, and the value
of <b>$TEST</b> will be popped off the stack, setting it back to 1 (true).
As a result, on the next line, the <b>ELSE</b> command will cause
the rest of that line to be ignored.</p>

<p>At the second iteration of the <b>FOR</b> loop, the value of <tt>A</tt>
is false (0).
The first <b>IF</b> command will cause the rest of that line
to be ignored, and, on the next line, the <b>ELSE</b> command will cause
the text <tt>"FALSE&nbsp;1"</tt> to be written.</p>

<p>The next <b>IF</b> command will also cause the rest of that
line to be ignored, and, on the next line, the <b>ELSE</b> command will cause
the text <tt>"FALSE&nbsp;2"</tt> to be written.</p>
