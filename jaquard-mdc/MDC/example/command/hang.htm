<title>M[UMPS] Commands</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>H[ANG]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>Note: The amount of seconds to be specified may be a fractional
number. Many operating environments (especially those running on
UnixTM platforms) do not support fractional seconds. This is a
limitation of the operating environment, not a limitation of
M[UMPS]. For portability, therefore, one cannot rely on the
ability to use fractional numbers in this context.</p>

<p><tt><b>WRITE</b> DATA<br>
<b>HANG</b> 15<br>
<b>WRITE $CHAR</b>(5)<br>
<b>READ</b> RESPONSE#1::1<br>
<b>IF</b> RESPONSE=<b>$CHAR</b>(6) <b>QUIT</b> "OK"<br>
<b>IF</b> RESPONSE=<b>$CHAR</b>(21) <b>QUIT</b> "NAK
received"<br>
<b>QUIT</b> "Device timed out"</tt><br>
Check that a device responds according to protocol within defined
timing constraints.</p>

<p>Note: In general it is not a good idea to use<br>
<tt><b>IF</b> ERROR <b>WRITE</b> ERRORMSG <b>HANG</b> 20<br>
<b>WRITE</b> # ; Clears screen<br>
<b>QUIT</b></tt><br>
This example will give the user 20 seconds to read the error
message, but it is better to use<br>
<tt><b>IF</b> ERROR <b>DO</b><br>
. <b>WRITE</b> ERRORMSG<br>
. <b>WRITE</b> !,"Press &lt;return&gt; to continue: "<br>
. <b>READ</b> DUMMY:20<br>
. <b>QUIT</b><br>
<b>WRITE</b> # ; Clears screen<br>
<b>QUIT</b></tt><br>
In this case, the user can clear the screen when he/she has read
the message, and does not have to wait until the full 20 seconds
have passed. Of course, if the error message is important enough,
one may wish to leave out the time-out altogether.</p>

<p>Examples with naked references:</p>

<p><b>HANG</b> DELTATIME<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,<br>
<b>HANG</b> ^(3,4)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,3,</tt><br>
; Actual reference is: <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt></p>
