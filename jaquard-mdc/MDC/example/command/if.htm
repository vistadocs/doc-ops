<title>M[UMPS] Commands</title>

<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>I[F]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p><tt><b>IF</b> A=5 <b>SET</b> B=3 <b>WRITE</b> "..."</tt><br>
The most common method to make several actions dependent on one
test.</p>

<p><tt><b>IF</b> (A&gt;5)&amp;(A&lt;16) <b>WRITE</b>
"6 <img src="leq.xbm"> value <img src="leq.xbm"> 15"<br>
<b>IF</b> A&gt;5 <b>IF</b> A&lt;16 <b>WRITE</b> "6 <img src="leq.xbm"> value <img src="leq.xbm"> 15"<br>
<b>IF</b> A&gt;5,A&lt;16 <b>WRITE</b> "6 <img src="leq.xbm"> value <img src="leq.xbm"> 15"</tt><br>
The above three lines have practically the same effect. All three
test whether or not the value of a local variable is between two
values, and write a message if this is the case. In the first
example, however, the test <tt>A&lt;16</tt> is also evaluated
when <tt>A&lt;5</tt>, whereas in the other two cases, because the
first IF command on the line was unsuccessful, the rest of the
line was already being skipped.<br>
There is no difference between the second and third line, other
than that the third line is more compact.</p>

<p>The advantage of not evaluating expressions if an earlier test in
the same line yielded a <i>false</i> result may become obvious in
cases like:<br>
<tt><b>IF</b> X=3,^|"FARAWAY"|GLOBAL(1,2,3) <b>DO</b>
ACTION</tt><br>
By putting the 'simple' test at the beginning of the line,
transactions across the network may be prevented in those cases
where there is no need to execute them.</p>

<p>Examples with naked references:</p>

<p><b>IF</b> VALUE<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,</tt><br>
<tt><b>IF</b> ^(3,4)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,3,</tt><br>
; Actual reference is: <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt></p>
