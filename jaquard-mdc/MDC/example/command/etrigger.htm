<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>ETR[IGGER]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application
Programmer's Interface standard.</p>

<p>This command causes an event to occur. For examples, see the
structured system variable <b>^$WINDOW</b>. Depending on the type
of event thst is to occur, the event specification will be
in:<br>
<tt><b>^$WINDOW</b> (window,"EVENT",type)<br>
<b>^$WINDOW</b>(window,"G",gadget,"EVENT",type)<br>
<b>^$WINDOW</b>(window,"T",timer,"EVENT",type)<br>
<b>^$WINDOW</b>(window,"M",menu,"CHOICE",item,"EVENT",type)</tt></p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application
Programmer's Interface standard.</p>

<p>The ability to trigger events that are to be processed by
other processes is introduced.</p>

<p>Suppose that the value of local variable <tt>X</tt> is the process-ID
of one process, and that this process is intended to process
events that are triggered by another job. Let the value of local
variable <tt>Y</tt> be the process-ID of this other job.</p>

<p>Either process could issue a command like:<br>
<tt><b>SET ^$JOB</b>(X,"EVENT","IPC",Y)="^PROGRAM"</tt></p>

<p>When the process identified by Y issues the command<br>
<tt><b>ETRIGGER</b> "<b>^$JOB</b>(X,""EVENT"",""IPC"",Y)"</tt><br>
the process identified by <tt>X</tt> will start executing the
routine <tt>^PROGRAM</tt>. When the process identified by
<tt>X</tt> started recognition of <tt>IPC</tt> events with the
command <tt><b>ESTART</b> "IPC"</tt>, this processing will occur
synchronously, when the recognition was started with
<tt><b>ASTART</b> "IPC"</tt>, this processing will occur
asynchronously.</p>
