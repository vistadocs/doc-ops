<title>M[UMPS] Commands</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>M[UMPS] Commands</h1>

<h2>RS[AVE]</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This command copies parts of a routine from a local or global variable 
into the implementation specific internal storage from which routines 
are executed. Typical practice is that this command creates new routines,
or updates the executable version of a routine after its M[UMPS] code 
has been modified while temporarily stored in a local or global 
variable.</p>

<p>Any keywords in the argument of the command are processed in 
strict left-to-right order. When multiple equivalent parameters 
are encountered, the last occurrence processed will define the 
action(s) to be taken.</p>

<p>If the name of the routine in the argument of the <b>RSAVE</b> command 
is equal to the name of the routine executing the command in question, 
an error will occur (<a href="../mdcerror.htm#M25">M25</a>),
and the internally stored routine will not be modified.</p>

<p>Assume that the array <tt>EDIT</tt> is populated as in the final example 
of the <b>RLOAD</b> command, then the command <tt><b>RSAVE</b> 
DEMO:EDIT</tt> will create a new version of the routine <tt>DEMO</tt> 
with the following content:</p>

<pre>
DEMO ; This is an example
 <b>WRITE</b> !,"This is the second line"
 <b>WRITE</b> !,"Last line with WRITE command"
 ;This stays as well
 <b>QUIT</b>
 ;The final word
</pre>

<p>It is expected that the various nodes in the array <tt>EDIT</tt> contain 
valid M[UMPS] code. If the array contains invalid data, the standard 
does not (yet) specify any particular behaviour.</p>

<p>Examples with naked references:</p>

<p><b>RSAVE</b> ROUTINE:VARIABLE<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,<br>
<b>RSAVE</b> NAME:^(3,4)</tt><br>
; Copy code from <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,3,</tt><br>
; Actual reference is: <tt>^ABC(1,3,4)</tt></p>

<p>Note: the code will be fetched from <tt>^ABC(1,3,4,1)</tt>,
<tt>^ABC(1,3,4,2)</tt> etcetera, but the naked indicator will
remain <tt>^ABC(1,3,</tt>.</p>

<p><b>RSAVE</b> ROUTINE:VARIABLE:PARAMETERS<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> ^ABC(1,2)="reset naked indicator"</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now <tt>^ABC(1,<br>
<b>RLOAD</b> NAME:^(3,4):(KEY1=^(5,6):KEY2=^(7,8))</tt><br>
; Fetch the value for the first parameter from <tt>^(5,6)</tt> = 
<tt>^ABC(1,5,6)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,5,</tt><br>
; Fetch the value from <tt>^(7,8)</tt> = <tt>^ABC(1,5,7,8)</tt><br>
; Naked indicator is now: <tt>^ABC(1,5,7,</tt><br>
; Copy code from <tt>^(3,4)</tt> = <tt>^ABC(1,5,7,3,4)</tt><br>

Note: the code will be fetched from <tt>^ABC(1,5,7,3,4,1)</tt>,
<tt>^ABC(1,5,7,3,4,2)</tt> etcetera, but the naked indicator will
remain <tt>^ABC(1,5,7,3,</tt>.</p>
