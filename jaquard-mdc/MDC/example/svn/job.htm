<title>Special variables -- $JOB</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Special variables -- $JOB</h1>

<a name="$J[OB]"></a>
<h2>$J[OB]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The value of this variable is a (unique in the current M[UMPS]
system) number for a M[UMPS] process.</p>

<p><tt><b>SET</b> ^UTILITY(<b>$JOB</b>,x)="job-dependent information"</tt></p>

<p>Note that with the advent of networked computers and the possibility
to activate multiple M[UMPS] environments on a single computer,
the value of <b>$JOB</b> may no longer be unique. The value of
<b>$SYSTEM</b>_<b>$JOB</b> will always be unique.</p>
