<title>Special variables -- $QUIT</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Special variables -- $QUIT</h1>

<a name="$Q[UIT]"></a>
<h2>$Q[UIT]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This variable indicates whether the current block of code was
called as an extrinsic function, or as a subroutine.</p>

<p>This special variable is mainly used in error-trapping
conditions. Its value tells whether the current DO level was
reached by means of a subroutine call (<tt><b>DO</b> xxx</tt>) or
by a function call (<tt><b>SET</b> variable=$$xxx</tt>).<br>
A typical way of exiting from an error trap is:<br>
<tt><b>QUIT</b>:<b>$QUIT</b> "" <b>QUIT</b></tt></p>
