<title>Special variables -- $X</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Special variables -- $X</h1>

<a name="$X"></a>
<h2>$X</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>Note: the value <b>$X</b> is an approximation of the current
location of the horizontal position of the cursor on the current
I/O device. There are many examples where the value of <b>$X</b>
deviates significantly from the actual horizontal position of the
cursor. This is a problem that is somewhat relieved by an
addition in the 1995 standard.</p>

<p><tt>&gt; <b>FOR</b> I=1:1:50 <b>WRITE</b> I,"__" <b>IF</b>
<b>$X</b>&gt;20 <b>WRITE</b> !<br>
1__2__3__4__5__6__7__<br>
8__9__10__11__12__13__<br>
14__15__16__17__18__19__<br>
20__21__22__23__24__25__<br>
26__27__28__29__30__31__<br>
32__33__34__35__36__37__<br>
38__39__40__</tt></p>

<p>The value of <b>$X</b> is defined to be an approximation of the
horizontal cursor coordinate, and the standard provides no
guarantees about the accuracy of this approximation.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This standard allows the value of <b>$X</b> to be re-defined in a
<b>SET</b> command, so that, in case the value of <b>$X</b> lost
synchronization with the actual value of the cursor, the
programmer can correct the value of <b>$X</b>.</p>

<p>If the cursor is positioned using any of the functions from the
ANSI X3.64 standard, the standard defines that the value of
<b>$X</b> will be updated accurately.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Language Standard.</p>

<p>The initial value of <b>$X</b> is implementation-dependent.
However, if the initial value of <b>$IO</b> is the empty string,
then the initial value of <b>$X</b> is 0 (zero).</p>
