<title>Special variables -- $STORAGE</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Special variables -- $STORAGE</h1>

<a name="$S[TORAGE]"></a>
<h2>$S[TORAGE]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard</p>

<p>The value of this variable is an implementation-specific measure
for the amount of storage that is available for the manipulation
of local variables.</p>

<p><tt><b>IF</b> <b>$STORAGE</b>&lt;500
<b>WRITE</b> !,"Now",<b>$STORAGE</b>," left."</tt></p>

<p>Assume that the following subroutine is available for
execution:</p>

<pre>
X <b>WRITE</b> !,"Before NEW command: ",<b>$STORAGE</b>
 <b>NEW</b> A,B,C
 <b>WRITE</b> !,"After NEW command:  ",<b>$STORAGE</b>
 <b>SET</b> A=1,B=2,C=3
 <b>WRITE</b> !,"After SET command:  ",<b>$STORAGE</b>
 <b>SET</b> LEVEL=LEVEL+1
 <b>IF</b> LEVEL&lt;6 <b>DO</b> X
 <b>QUIT</b>
</pre>

<p>Then, the commands<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> LEVEL=0 <b>WRITE</b> "Start: ",<b>$STORAGE</b>
<b>DO</b> X</tt><br>
will produce (note that these changes are implementation-specific):

<pre>
Start: 153536
Before NEW command: 153456                        Change is 80

After NEW command:  152400                        Change is 48
After SET command:  152208                       Change is 192
Before NEW command: 152208                         Change is 0
After NEW command:  152160                        Change is 48
After SET command:  151968                       Change is 192

Keep in mind that every <b>NEW</b> command creates a new
environment for one or more variables. Although the old
environment for those variables may be temporarily hidden, that
environment still consumes space in the memory allocated to local
variable storage.</p>
