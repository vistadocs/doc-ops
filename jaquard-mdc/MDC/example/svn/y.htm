<title>Special variables -- $Y</title>

<h1>Special variables -- $Y</h1>

<a name="$Y"></a>
<h2>$Y</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>Note: the value <b>$Y</b> is an approximation of the current
location of the vertical position of the cursor on the current
I/O device. There are many examples where the value of <b>$Y</b>
deviates significantly from the actual vertical position of the
cursor. This is a problem that is somewhat relieved by an
addition in the 1995 standard.</p>

<p><tt>&gt; IF <b>$Y</b>&gt;MAXLIN <b>WRITE</b> #!,HEADER</tt></p>

<p>The value of <b>$Y</b> is defined to be an approximation of the
vertical cursor coordinate, and the standard provides no
guarantees about the accuracy of this approximation.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This standard allows the value of <b>$Y</b> to be re-defined in a
<b>SET</b> command, so that, in case the value of <b>$Y</b> lost
synchronization with the actual value of the cursor, the
programmer can correct the value of <b>$Y</b>.</p>

<p>If the cursor is positioned using any of the functions from the
ANSI X3.64 standard, the standard defines that the value of
<b>$Y</b> will be updated accurately.</p>

<p>Assuming that <b>$X</b>=20 and<b> $Y</b>=10, the effect of the
command <tt><b>WRITE $CHAR</b>(27),"[3;4H"</tt> will most likely
be that <b>$X</b> is incremented by 6 (the number of characters
transmitted) or by 5 (some implementations do not increment
<b>$X</b> when a control character like <b>$CHAR</b>(27) (escape)
is transmitted).<br>
The effect of the command <tt><b>WRITE /CUP</b>(4,3)</tt>,
however, will be that <b>$X</b>=2 and <b>$Y</b>=3.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Language Standard.</p>

<p>The initial value of <b>$Y</b> is implementation-dependent.
However, if the initial value of <b>$IO</b> is the empty string,
then the initial value of <b>$Y</b> is 0 (zero).</p>
