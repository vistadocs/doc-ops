<h1>Special variables -- $EREF</h1>

<a name="$ER[EF]"></a>
<h2>$ER[EF]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application
Programmer's Interface standard.</p>

<p>The value of this special variable is the name of the node in
<b>^$WINDOW</b> that was involved in the most recent error that
occurred.</p>

<p>Assuming that there is no button defined with the name
<tt>"something wrong"</tt>, <br>
<tt><b>SET ^$WINDOW</b>("DEMO","DEFBUTTON")="something
wrong"</tt><br>
will cause an error with <b>$ECODE</b> containing
<tt>",M52,"</tt> and <b>$EREF</b> equal to the canonic form of
the name of the above reference to <b>^$WINDOW</b>.</p>
