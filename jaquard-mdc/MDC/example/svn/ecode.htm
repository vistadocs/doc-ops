<title>Special variables -- $ECODE</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Special variables -- $ECODE</h1>

<a name="$EC[ODE]"></a>
<h2>$EC[ODE]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This variable provides information about the error-conditions
that are unresolved.</p>

<p><tt><b>IF</b> $ECODE[",M6," <b>WRITE</b> "Undefined local variable"</tt></p>

<p>Note: the leftmost character of the value of <b>$ECODE</b> is
always a comma. This means that every error code that is stored
in <b>$ECODE</b> is surrounded by commas. If <b>$ECODE</b>
contains <tt>"M61"</tt>, it would also contain <tt>"M6"</tt>, so
it is better to include the commas in the value to check for:
check whether <b>$ECODE</b> contains <tt>",M6,"</tt>.</p>

<p>For more examples of the use of special variable <b>$ECODE</b>,
see the function <b>$STACK</b>.</p>
