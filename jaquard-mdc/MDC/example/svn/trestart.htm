<title>Special variables -- $TRESTART</title>
<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Special variables -- $TRESTART</h1>

<a name="$TR[ESTART]"></a>
<h2>$TR[ESTART]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The value of this variable identifies the number of transaction
restarts that has occurred for the current transaction.</p>

<p><tt><b>TSTART</b> ():<b>TRANSACTIONID</b>="Demo"<br>
<b>IF</b> '<b>$TRESTART DO</b><br>
. ; Initialize only once<br>
. <b>QUIT</b></tt><br>
Whether a restart occurs because of an explicit <b>TRESTART</b>
command or because the system encountered consistency problems
while processing a <b>TCOMMIT</b> command, the special variable
<b>$TRESTART</b> is incremented each time a transaction is
restarted.</p>

<p><tt><b>IF $TRESTART</b>&gt;20 <b>WRITE</b> "Problems..."
<b>TROLLBACK  QUIT</b></tt><br>
If a transaction encounters too many restarts, there probably is
a reason that can only be resolved externally.</p>
