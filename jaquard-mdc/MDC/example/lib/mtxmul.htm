<body background="../mbe.gif">
<h1>Library Functions -- $%MTXMUL^MATH</h1>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard as part of the
library for Matrix Mathematics.</p>

<p>This function multiplies two matrices, and returns the result in a third
matrix. The result matrix may not be either of the source matrices.</p>

<p>Assuming that the matrices DEMO and INV are as in the example with the
function MTXINV, then the function call</p>

<p><tt><b>SET</b> X=<b>$%MTXMUL^MATH</b>(.DEMO,.INV,.R,4,4,4)</tt></p>

<p>will return the value <tt>1</tt> in <tt>X</tt> and as matrix <tt>R</tt>:</p>

<pre>
1   0   0   0
0   1   0   0
0   0   1   0
0   0   0   1
</pre>

<p>Assuming that the matrices A and B contain:</p>

<pre>
        A                        B      
 1    2   -1    0           3    1    2
 4    0    2    1          -4    5   -2
 2   -5    1    2           1    0    3
                            2    3   -1
</pre>

<p>then the function call <tt><b>SET</b>
X=<b>$%MTXMUL^MATH</b>(.A,.B,.R,3,4,3)</tt> will return the value
<tt>1</tt> in X and as the matrix <tt>R</tt>:</p>

<pre>
 -6   11   -5
 16    7   13
 31  -17   15
</pre>
