<h1>Library Functions -- $%MTXSCA^MATH</h1>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard as part of the
library for Matrix Mathematics.</p>

<p>This function multiplies a matrix with a scalar. </p>

<p>Cells that were not defined in the source matrices will not be defined
in the result matrices (sparsity is retained) (a cell containing "#" means no
defined value):</p>

<p>Assuming that the matrices A and B contain:</p>

<pre>
       A                        B      
 1    2   -1    #          #    1    2
 4    #    2    1         -4    5   -2
 2   -5    #    2          1    #    3
                           2    3   -1
</pre>

<p>the function call <tt><b>SET</b>
X=<b>$%MTXSCA^MATH</b>(.A,.R,3,4,10)</tt> will return the value
<tt>1</tt> in <tt>X</tt> and return as the matrix <tt>R</tt>:</p>

<pre>
 10   20   -10    #
 40    #    20   10
 20  -50     #   20
</pre>

<p>The function call <tt><b>SET</b> X=<b>$%MTXSCA^MATH</b>(.B,.R,4,3,-
2.5)</tt> will return the value <tt>1</tt> in <tt>X</tt> and return as
the matrix <tt>R</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  #     -2.5    -5
 10    -12.5     5
 -2.5    #      -7.5
 -5     -7.5     2.5
