<h1>Library Functions -- $%MTXINV^MATH</h1>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard as part of the
library for Matrix Mathematics.</p>

<p>This function solves a special matrix equation: [A] * [Result] = [unit
matrix],</p>

<p>Assuming that matrix <tt>DEMO</tt> contains:</p>

<pre>
 1    2    0    0
 3    4    0    0
 0    0   -1    2
 0    0    3    1
</pre>

<p>the function call <tt><b>SET</b>
X=<b>$%MTXINV^MATH</b>(.DEMO,.INV,4)</tt> will return the value
<tt>14</tt> in <tt>X</tt> and as matrix <tt>INV</tt>:</p>

<pre>
-1.99999  0.99999   0        0
 1.49999  0.49999   0        0
 0        0         0.14285  0.28571
 0        0         0.42857  0.14285
