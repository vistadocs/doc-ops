<h1>Library Functions -- $%MTXEQU^MATH</h1>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard as part of the
library for Matrix Mathematics.</p>

<p>This function either solves a matrix equation and returns the value of
the determinant of the matrix, or returns an empty value to indicate
that no matrix can be computed to solve the equation.</p>

<p>The matrix equation to be resolved is [A] * [Result] = [B].</p>

<p>Assuming that the matrixes <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> contain:</p>

<pre>
       A                  B
4   2   3   1         2   1   0
1   2   3   4         1   4  0.5
3   4   1   2         2   3   0
2   1   3   4         0   0   1
</pre>

<p>then the function call <tt><b>SET</b>
X=<b>$%MTXEQU^MATH</b>(.A,.B,.R,4,3)</tt> would return the value
<tt>-60</tt> in <tt>X</tt> and return as matrix <tt>R</tt>:</p>

<pre>
0.21666  -1.85   0.20833
0.78333   2.15   0.29166
0.61666   1.65   0.20833
0.55      0.85   0.375
</pre>
