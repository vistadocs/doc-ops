<h1>Library Functions -- $%COMPARE^CHARACTER</h1>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard as an
override mechanism for collating strings.</p>

<p>This function returns a value that indicates the order in which
two strings collate, when compared in the specified environment.
The environment specified may be:
<ul>
<li>absent, in which case the collating scheme for the current
process prevails</li>

<li>the name of a global variable, in which case the collating scheme
for that global variable will be used</li>

<li>the name of a character set profile, in which case the collating
scheme for that character set profile will be used</li>
</ul></p>
