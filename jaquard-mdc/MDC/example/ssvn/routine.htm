<h1>Structured System variables -- ^$ROUTINE</h1>

<a name="^$R[OUTINE]"></a>
<h2>^$R[OUTINE]</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This structured system variable provides information about the
routines that are currently known to the M[UMPS] system.</p>

<p><tt><b>WRITE</b> !,"Routine directory:"<br>
<b>SET</b> R="" <b>FOR</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>SET</b> R=<b>$O</b>(<b>^$ROUTINE</b>(R)) <b>QUIT</b>:R=""&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>DO</b><br>
. <b>WRITE</b> !,R<br>
. <b>SET</b> C=<b>$GET</b>(<b>^$ROUTINE</b>(J,"CHARACTER"))<br>
. <b>IF</b> C'="" <b>WRITE</b> ?30,"character set is """,C,"""."<br>
. <b>QUIT</b></tt></p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>If your implementation has granted you the privilege to do so,
you may be able to remove a routine from the system by executing
the command<br>
<tt><b>KILL ^$ROUTINE</b>(name)</tt></p>
