<h2>M1, Naked indicator undefined</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The naked indicator is undefined at the start of a M[UMPS]
process, or after a reference to an unsubscripted global variable
has been made.<br>
The sequence of commands <tt><b>SET</b> ^A=3,^(4)=5</tt> would
cause this error to occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M2"></a>
<h2>M2, Invalid combination with P <u>fncodatom</u></h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>An <u>fncodatom</u> is one of the special formatting parameters
of the function <b>$FNUMBER</b>. Currently, the valid codes that
may be specified as such are <tt>+</tt> (plus, force plus sign),
<tt>,</tt> (comma, insert delimiters every three digits), <tt>-</tt>
(minus, suppress minus sign), <tt>p</tt> or <tt>P</tt>
(represent negative numbers in parentheses) and <tt>t</tt> or
<tt>T</tt> (trailing sign). Any incompatible combination of these
codes or any other character specified in the second parameter of
the function <b>$FNUMBER</b> will cause this error to occur.</p>

<p><tt><b>WRITE</b> <b>$FNUMBER</b>(AMOUNT,"+Q")<br>
<b>WRITE</b> <b>$FNUMBER</b>(AMOUNT,"-t",3)<br>
<b>WRITE</b> <b>$FNUMBER</b>(AMOUNT,"Z",2)</tt></p>

<h2>M3, $RANDOM seed less than 1</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p><tt><b>$RANDOM</b>(6)</tt> returns one of the values 0, 1, 2, 3,
4 or 5.<br>
<tt><b>$RANDOM</b>(-6)</tt> does not return one of the values -5,
-4, -3, -2, -1 or 0, but causes this error to occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M4"></a>
<h2>M4, No true condition in $SELECT</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This error is most likely to occur in constructions like<br>
<tt><b>WRITE
$SELECT</b>(X&gt;50:"Large",X&lt;50:"Small")</tt><br>
(Note: in the case that <tt>X=50</tt>).</p>

<hr>

<a name="M5"></a>
<h2>M5, <u>lineref</u> less than zero</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This error means that, in the context of a reference to the
function <b>$TEXT</b>, a reference was encountered that has a
negative offset value.</p>

<p><tt><b>WRITE</b> <b>$TEXT</b>(+LINECOUNT^MYROUT)</tt><br>
(and the value of local variable <tt>LINECOUNT</tt> is
negative).</p>

<p>A reference a <b>DO</b>, <b>GOTO</b> or <b>JOB</b> command
with a negative offset will cause an error with code 
<a href="#M12">M12</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M6"></a>
<h2>M6, Undefined <u>lvn</u></h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This error means that an attempt was made to obtain the value of
a local variable, while that local variable has no defined value.
Note that a variable that has no defined value may have
descendants that do have a defined value.</p>

<p><tt><b>KILL</b> X<br>
<b>SET</b> X(12,13,14)=123<br>
<b>SET</b>:<b>$DATA</b>(X(12)) ABC=X(12)</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="M7"></a>
<h2>M7, Undefined <u>gvn</u></h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This error means that an attempt was made to obtain the value of
a global variable, while that global variable has no defined
value. Note that a variable that has no defined value may have
descendants that do have a defined value.</p>

<p><tt><b>KILL</b> ^X<br>
<b>SET</b> ^X(12,13,14)=123<br>
<b>SET</b>:<b>$DATA</b>(^X(12)) ABC=^X(12)</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="M8"></a>
<h2>M8, Undefined <u>svn</u></h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The intrinsic special variables (<b>$X</b>, <b>$IO</b>, etcetera)
always have a value. This error means that a reference was
encountered to an entity that has the syntax of an intrinsic
special variable name, but that does not exist as such, e.g.
<b>$DEVICE</b> in an implentation that meets the 1990 standard,
but not the 1995 standard, or $CPU.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M9"></a>
<h2>M9, Divide by zero</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This error means that during the evaluation of an expression
containing a division (either common (/) or integer division
(\)), a 'righthand' operand was encountered that has a zero
value.</p>

<p><tt><b>SET</b> (TOTAL,NUMBER)=0<br>
<b>SET</b> I="" <b>FOR SET</b> I=<b>$ORDER</b>(A(I))
<b>QUIT</b>:I="" <b>DO</b><br>
&nbsp;. <b>SET</b> N=N+1,TOTAL=TOTAL+A(I)<br>
&nbsp;. <b>QUIT</b><br>
<b>SET</b> AVERAGE=TOTAL/NUMBER</tt><br>
This error will occur in the case that array A has no members.</p>

<p><tt><b>SET</b> X="Apples"<br>
<b>SET</b> Y=TOTAL\X+Y</tt></p>

<p>This error will also occur for:</p>

<p><tt><b>SET</b> X=N#0<br>
<b>SET</b> X=0**-1</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="M10"></a>
<h2>M10, Invalid pattern match range</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>If, in a pattern specification, the number of occurrences of a
part of a pattern is specified (number.number), the first number
gives the lower bound, and the second number the upper bound. If
the upper bound is less than the lower bound this error condition
occurs.</p>

<p><tt><b>IF</b> X?1.5A3N6.4A </tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="M11"></a>
<h2>M11, No parameters passed</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When execution 'falls through' and reaches a line that starts
with a label that has a parameter list, this error will occur.
Labels with a parameter list should only be executed when invoked
as a subroutine, or as an extrinsic function or extrinsic
variable.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M12"></a>
<h2>M12, Invalid <u>lineref</u> (negative offset)</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>DO</b>, <b>GOTO</b> or <b>JOB</b> command is executed,
and the line that is specified is in the form
<tt>LABEL+OFFSET^ROUTINE</tt>, this error will occur if the
<tt>OFFSET</tt> has a negative value.</p>

<p>A reference to the function <b>$TEXT</b> with a negative
<tt>OFFSET</tt> will cause an error with code
<a href="#M5">M5</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M13"></a>
<h2>M13, Invalid <u>lineref</u> (label not found)</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>DO</b>, <b>GOTO</b> or <b>JOB</b> command is executed,
or when a reference to the function <b>$TEXT</b> is evaluated,
and the line that is specified is in the form
<tt>LABEL+OFFSET^ROUTINE</tt> or <tt>LABEL+OFFSET</tt>, this
error will occur if either there is no label in the specified
routine that corresponds to the specified label, or the value of
<tt>OFFSET</tt> is so high that the reference no longer evaluates
to a valid line in the specified routine.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M14"></a>
<h2>M14, <u>line</u> <i>level</i> not 1</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>DO</b>, <b>GOTO</b> or <b>JOB</b> command is executed,
and the line that is specified is in the form
<tt>LABEL+OFFSET^ROUTINE</tt> or <tt>LABEL+OFFSET</tt>, this
error will occur if the line that is specified does not have a
<i>level</i> of 1, i.e. the line starts with one or more period
characters. Lines that have a <i>level</i> higher than 1 can only
be invoked by an argumentless <b>DO</b> command.</p>

<p>The <i>level</i> of a line is equal to 'number of dots at the
start of the line' plus 1.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M15"></a>
<h2>M15, Undefined index variable</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>FOR</b> command is executed, and the range
specification is of the form FROM:STEP or FROM:STEP:UNTIL, and it
is not possible to assign a value to the index variable of the
<b>FOR</b> loop, this error will occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M16"></a>
<h2>M16, Argumented QUIT not allowed</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>QUIT</b> command is executed as the termination of an
extrinsic function, the value specified in the argument of the
<b>QUIT</b> command is the value that is returned to the
environment that invoked the extrinsic function. When a
<b>QUIT</b> command is executed in any other context, and an
argument is present, this error will occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M17"></a>
<h2>M17, Argumented QUIT required</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>QUIT</b> command is executed as the termination of an
extrinsic function, the value specified in the argument of the
<b>QUIT</b> command is the value that is returned to the
environment that invoked the extrinsic function. When a
<b>QUIT</b> command is executed in this context, and no argument
is present, this error will occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M18"></a>
<h2>M18, Fixed length READ not greater than zero</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a <b>READ</b> command is executed, and an argument is of the
form <tt>VARIABLE#LENGTH</tt>, this error will occur if the value
of <tt>LENGTH</tt> is less than 1.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M19"></a>
<h2>M19, Cannot copy a tree or subtree into itself</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a MERGE command is executed, and there is an overlap between
the source and the destination of the information to be copied,
this error will occur.</p>

<p><tt><b>MERGE</b> ^ABC(1,2,3)=^ABC(1,2,3,4,5,6)<br>
<b>MERGE</b> ^ABC(1,2,3,4,5)=^ABC(1,2,3,4)<br>
<b>MERGE</b> ^ABC(1,2,3)=^ABC(1,2,3)<br>
<b>MERGE</b> ^|HERE|ABC(1,2,3)=^|THERE|ABC(1,2,3)</tt><br>
(in the last example, the error will occur if the value of
<tt>HERE</tt> happens to be equal to the value of
<tt>THERE</tt>).</p>

<hr>

<a name="M20"></a>
<h2>M20, <u>line</u> must have <u>formallist</u></h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When an extrinsic function is invoked (e.g.
<tt>$$XXX^YYY(P1,P2)</tt>), and the label in the routine that is
invoked to calculate the function value does not have a parameter
list (in this example, the label <tt>XXX</tt> in routine
<tt>YYY</tt>), this error will occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M21"></a>
<h2>M21, Algorithm specification invalid</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a label occurs with a parameter list (a formallist), and the
same name occurs multiple times in this parameter list, this
error will occur.</p>

<p>Note that it does make sense to be able to have the same name
multiple times in a parameter list when a function or subroutine
is invoked (actuallist), but not in the formal parameter list at
the start of that function or subroutine.</p>

<p><tt><b>SET</b> SUM=$$ADD(A,A)</tt><br>
is a valid function call.</p>

<p><tt>ADD(X,X) <b>QUIT</b> X+X</tt><br>
will cause this error to occur; most likely, this should have
been<br>
<tt>ADD(X,Y) <b>QUIT</b> X+Y</tt></p>

<hr>

<a name="M22"></a>
<h2>M22, SET or KILL to <b>^$GLOBAL</b> when data in global</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The structured system variable <b>^$GLOBAL</b> contains
information about global variables (allocation, protection,
access control, etcetera). Certain information about global
variables can only be entered into these structured variables
before the global variables that they describe are actually
created. When creating the global variable in question, the
parameters specified in the structured system variable will be
applied, and it may not generally be possible to undo this
without completely re-creating the global variable in
question.</p>

<p>An attempt to define or delete such information in this
structured system variable about a global variable that currently
exists will cause this error to occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M23"></a>
<h2>M23, SET or KILL to <b>^$JOB</b> for non-existent job number</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The structured system variable <b>^$JOB</b> contains
information about M[UMPS] processes (execution status, ownership,
etcetera). Information about M[UMPS] processes can only be
defined or modified in these structured variables while the
process in question exists in the system.</p>

<p>An attempt to define or delete information in this structured
system variable about a M[UMPS] process that currently does not
exist will cause this error to occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M24"></a>
<h2>M24, Change to collation algorithm while subscripted local
variables defined</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The structured system variable <b>^$GLOBAL</b> contains
information about global variables (allocation, protection,
access control, etcetera). Certain information about global
variables can only be entered into these structured variables
before the global variables that they describe are actually
created. When creating the subtree in question, the collation
algorithm specified in the structured system variable will be
applied, and it may not generally be possible to undo this
without completely re-creating the global variable in
question.</p>

<p>The 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard allows for a
specification of a collation algorithm at the 'top level' of a
global variable only.</p>

<p>An attempt to define or delete information related to the
collation algorithm of a subtree in a global variable in this
structured system variable while that subtree exists will cause
this error to occur.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M25"></a>
<h2>M25, Attempt to modify currently executing routine</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This error code means that an attempt was made to execute an 
<b>RSAVE</b> command specifying the currently executing routine as the 
routine to be re-created. When this error occurs, the routine in 
question will not be modified.</p>

<hr>

<a name="M26"></a>
<h2>M26, Non-existent <u>environment</u></h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>When a reference is evaluated that contains an environment
specification, and the specified environment does not currently
exist, this error will occur.</p>

<p>Note that this error will not occur while building a definition
in a structured system variable.</p>

<p>Networks may go down<br>
<tt><b>SET</b> X=^|"LONDON"|CUSTOMER(ID)</tt></p>

<p>Or an environment may not exist at all...<br>

<h2>M27, Attempt to rollback a transaction that is not
restartable</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>One of the activities that may occur in the context of
transaction processing is a <i>restart</i>. A restart is a second
(or third, or...) attempt to process the complete
<i>transaction</i>. Whether or not a <i>transaction</i> is
actually restarted, depends on whether it is restartable. A
<i>transaction</i> is restartable if the initiating <b>TSTART</b>
command specifies a <u>restartargument</u>. A <i>restart</i> of a
restartable <i>transaction</i> causes execution to resume with
the initial <b>TSTART</b> command. A <i>restart</i> of a non-
restartable <i>transaction</i> ends the <i>transaction</i> and
causes this error to occur.</p>

<h2>M28, Mathematical function, parameter out of range</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>While the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard introduces the
concept of external calls and external libraries, that standard
does not yet define any specific external callable routines.</p>

<p>A future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard will contain a set of
mathematical functions that are accessible through the external
call syntax.</p>

<p>When one of these functions is called with one or more
inappopriate parameters, this error will occur.</p>

<h2>M29, SET or KILL on <u>ssvn</u> not allowed by
implementation</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>While the definition of the M[UMPS] language may allow for
certain syntactical constructs, not all implementation will allow
the use of these at all times.</p>

<p>When an attempt is made to (re-)define or remove information in a
structured system variable, while the implementation does not
allow such activity, this error will occur.</p>

<p><tt><b>KILL</b> <b>^$JOB</b>(JOBID)<br>

<h2>M30, Reference to <u>glvn</u> with different collating
sequence within a collating algorithm</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>In <tt><b>^$CHARACTER</b>(setname,"COLLATE")</tt>, an algorithm
may be specified that will be used internally by the M[UMPS]
system to establish the collating order of for a character-set.
The string that will be used internally for collating purposes is
computed by a function call equivalent to <tt><b>SET</b>
internal=$$entry^routine(actualvalue)</tt>. If such a function is
invoked, and a reference is evaluated to a variable that has a
different collating algorithm than the one that is being
computed, this error will occur.</p>

<h2>M31, <u>controlmnemonic</u> used for device without a
<u>mnemonicspace</u> selected</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The structured system variable <b>^$ROUTINE</b> contains

system variable will be applied, and it may not generally be
possible to undo this without completely re-creating the routine
in question.</p>

<h2>M37, READ from device identified by the empty string</h2>

<h2>M38, Invalid <u>ssvn</u> subscript</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The subscripts of local and global variables may be any string.
There are some restrictions in that most implementations do not
allow control characters in subscripts, and all implementations
observe a maximum length for subscripts, but those are the only
'normal' limitations.<br>
For structured system variables, however, the subscripts are
bound by semantical constraints: the first subscript in
<b>^$ROUTINE</b> must be the name of a routine, for instance.
When a reference is made to s structured system variable, and one
of the subscripts does not meet its semantical constraints, this
error will occur.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application

<h2>M41, Invalid LOCK argument within a TRANSACTION</h2>

<p>In the context of transaction processing, it is not allowed to
release resources within a <i>transaction</i>, if those resources
were obtained outside of the <i>transaction</i> in question. This
restriction is necessary to allow <i>transactions </i>to be
restartable.</p>

<b>TCOMMIT</b> commands. A trancaction may be cancelled by means
of a <b>TROLLBACK</b> command, or restarted by means of a
<b>TRESTART</b> command.</p>

<p>When a <b>TCOMMIT</b>, <b>TRESTART</b> or <b>TROLLBACK</b>

<h2>M45, Invalid GOTO reference</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>One addition in the 1990 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard is that
it has become possible to define blocks of code that can only be
entered at one point by means of an argumentless <b>DO</b>
command. Within such blocks, deeper nested blocks may be defined.
Within one such block, control may be transferred using a
<b>GOTO</b> command.</p>

<p>When a <b>GOTO</b> command is executed, and the destination of
the executed argument is a line within an 'indented' block, and
the <b>GOTO</b> command does not originate from a line at the
same level of indentation in the same 'indented' block, this
error will occur.</p>

<p>Note: in his article <i><b>GOTO Command Considered
Harmful</b></i> (March 1968, Communications of the ACM, Volume
11/3), Edsger W. Dijkstra warns against a certain improper usage
of <b>GOTO</b> commands. This restriction in the language helps
to prevent such improper usage.</p>

<h2>M56, Name length exceeds implementation's limit</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>In the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard, the length of a name
(for routines, as well as local and global variables) was
restricted to 8 characters. Implementations were not required to
interpret any characters beyond the 8th while determining the
unique meaning of a name.<br>
in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard, the length of a name
is no longer restricted. For portability, a maximum of 31
characters is specified, but implementations may allow for longer
names. If an application uses a name that is longer than the
number of characters that a specific implementation allows
(i.e. more than 31 characters), this error will occur.</p>

<p>The purpose of this error is to warn about possible portability
problems: if an application has taken advantage of an
implementation that offers names longer than the portability
limit, and subsequently is run on an application that binds names
to a lower limit (either the portability limit, or a number
between the portability limit and the 'roomier' implementation's
limit), this error will occur, rather than that different

<h2>M75, String length exceeds implementation's limit</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>For portability, the length of strings is limited. The 1977 ANSI
M[UMPS] language standard limited this length to 255 characters,
in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard, this limit will be
raised to:<br>
<ul>
<li>510 characters for namevalues</li>
<li>32,767 characters for values in local variables</li>
<li>510 characters for values in global variables</li>
<li>32,767 characters for values in structured system variables</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Implementations may offer longer strings than the portability
limit.</p>

<p>If an implementation attempts to create a string that is longer
than the string length limit for the implementation in question,
this error will occur.</p>

<p>This error will not occur for any string that has a length greater than
the portability limit, but less that the limit of the 
implementation.</p>
