<a name="object"></a>
<h2>object</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an a reference to
an object. Such a reference can be any expression that results
in a value that is a handle or pointer to an object.</p>

<hr>
<a name="objectref"></a>
<h2>objectref</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a
reference to an object. An object in this context may be a global variable,
a routine, a process, a device, a name in the LOCK table, a library,
a character set, etcetera.</p>

<hr>
<a name="openargument"></a>
<h2>openargument</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an occurrence of an argument of the
<b>OPEN</b> command. Examples of valid arguments for the <b>OPEN</b> command
appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>OPEN</b> command is
either an expression, optionally followed by more expressions (separated by
colons), or an indirection operator (<tt>@</tt>) followed by an expression
that evaluates to a list (separated by commas) of such arguments.</p>

<hr>
<a name="openparameters"></a>
<h2>openparameters</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents any implementation-specific parameters to
be observed for the device or file being opened, optionally followed by a
time-out specification. The implementation-specific parameters may be either a
single expression, or a list of expressions (separated by colons), enclosed in
parentheses.</p>

<hr>
<a name="oref"></a>
<h2>oref</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents any value that has
the data type OREF, i.e. any value that is a handle or
pointer to an object.</p>

<hr>
<a name="orientation"></a>
<h2>orientation</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a code for the orientation of an entity.
This metalanguage symbol occurs as an expression that evaluates to either
<tt>"H"</tt> (horizontal) or <tt>"V"</tt> (vertical), or to an
implementation-specific value (starts with <tt>"Z"</tt>).</p>

<hr>
<a name="owmethod"></a>
<h2>owmethod</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a method of an
object. Such a reference looks like an expression that
identifies an object, followed by a period, followed by
the name of that property (optionally followed by
a parameter list enclosed in parentheses; parameters
are separated by commas).</p>

<hr>
<a name="owproperty"></a>
<h2>owproperty</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a property of an
object. Such a reference looks like an expression that
identifies an object, followed by a period, followed by
the name of that property (optionally followed by
a parameter list enclosed in parentheses; parameters
are separated by commas).</p>

<hr>
<a name="owservice"></a>
<h2>owservice</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a property or method of an
object. Such a reference looks like an expression that

the name of that property (optionally followed by
a parameter list enclosed in parentheses; parameters
are separated by commas).</p>
