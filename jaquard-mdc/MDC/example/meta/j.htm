<h2>jobargument</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1984 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an occurrence of an argument of the
<b>JOB</b> command. Examples of valid arguments for the <b>JOB</b> command
appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>JOB</b> command is either
a destination, optionally followed by a colon, followed by
implementation-specific process parameters (either an expression or a list of
expressions (separated by colons) enclosed in parentheses), optionally
followed by a colon and a time-out specification, or an indirection operator
(<tt>@</tt>) followed by an expression that evaluates to a list (separated by
commas) of such arguments.</p>

<p>Modified in the 1990 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>There may be a parameter list between the destination and the optional
implementation-specific process parameters. Parameters in this parameter list
may only be passed by value.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>An argument of a <b>JOB</b> command may optionally include a specification
of the environment in which the process is intended to execute.</p>

<h2>jobenv</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a specification of an
environment. This symbol is used to indicate the environment
where a process is executing. The representation in this context
consists of a vertical bar, the name of an environment and
another vertical bar.</p>

<h2>jobparameters</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1984 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents any implementation-specific parameters to
be passed to the process being created, optionally followed by a time-out
specification. The implementation-specific parameters may be either a single
expression, or a list of expressions (separated by colons), enclosed in
parentheses.</p>
