<h2>bcolor</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the level of the blue component of a
color. A color component level is an integer value
(0 <img src="leq.xbm"> value <img src="leq.xbm"> 65,535).</p>

<hr>
<a name="binaryop"></a>
<h2>binaryop</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents any of the arithmetic or string binary
operators, i.e. one of <tt> +</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>/</tt>, <tt>\</tt>,
<tt>#</tt> or <tt>_</tt>.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The binary operator <tt>**</tt> is added to the definition of this
metalanguage symbol.</p>

<a name="Binding"></a>
<h2>Binding</h2>

<p>A specification of how two or more standards work together.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1994 ANSI GKS - M[UMPS] language binding.</p>

<h3>GKS - M[UMPS] binding.</h3>

<p>GKS (which stands for <b>G</b>raphical
<b>K</b>ernel <b>S</b>ystem) is a standard for producing and manipulating
graphical images. The functions in GKS are called as <b>controlmnemonic</b>s;
the <b>mnemonicspace</b> for GKS is <tt>"GKS"</tt> (<tt>WRITE
/name(parameters</tt>); all function-names are the same as the "short" names
in the ANSI FORTRAN binding to GKS; all parameters are the same in order and
meaning as in GKS. Parameters that receive output values are defined using the
M[UMPS] <b>READ</b> command.</p>

<p>The standards for GKS that were used for this binding is ANSI X3.124-1985,
which corresponds to ISO 7942-1985, and ANSI X3.124.1-1985 (GKS-FORTRAN
binding).</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<h3>ANSI X3.64 - M[UMPS] binding.</h3>

<p>ANSI X3.64 is a standard for device
control command code sequences. The VT-100 compatible terminals are an example
of terminals that meet this standard. The functions in X3.64 are called as
<b>controlmnemonic</b>s; the <b>mnemonicspace</b> for ANSI X3.64 is
<tt>"X3.64"</tt> (<tt>WRITE /name(parameters</tt>); all function-names are the
same as in ANSI X3.64; all parameters are the same in order and meaning as in
ANSI X3.64, except for row and column numbers: X3.64 uses co-ordinates that
start numbering from 1 (one), M[UMPS] uses co-ordinates that start numbering
from 0 (zero).</p>

<p>The standard for device control that was used for this binding is ANSI
X3.64-1979, which corresponds to ISO ???.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 X Window - M[UMPS] language binding.</p>

<h3>X Window - M[UMPS] binding.</h3>

<p>X Window is a system architecture that
consists of several layers. This binding is to the X Window System Routine
Libraries as produced by the X Consortium, the Intrinsic Toolkit so provided
and the Motif Widget and Routine set as produced by the Open Software
Foundation. The functions from the various component libraries are called
using the external call syntax: <tt>$&XLIB.name(parameters)</tt>,
<tt>$&XMOTIF.name(parameters)</tt>, <tt>$&XMOTIFRM.name(parameters)</tt>,
<tt>$&XTOOLKIT.name(parameters)</tt> and <tt>$&X.name(parameters)</tt>.
Parameters are the same in order and meaning as in the definition of the
various component libraries.</p>

<p>At the moment in time that this binding was produced, for all of these layers
of the X Window system a standard was being prepared, but not yet finalized.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<h3>POSIX.1 - M[UMPS] binding.</h3>

<p>POSIX is a standard that describes a
number of system services and support routines to access constructs described
by this standard. (Further specifics to be included after the taskgroup
decides how to bind.)</p>
