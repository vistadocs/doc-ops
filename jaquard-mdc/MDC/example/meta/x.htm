<h2>xargument</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an occurrence of an argument of the
<b>XECUTE</b> command. Examples of valid arguments for the <b>XECUTE</b>
command appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>XECUTE</b>
command is either an expression, optionally followed by a colon and a time-out
specification, or an indirection operator (<tt>@</tt>) followed by an
expression that evaluates to a list (separated by commas) of such arguments.</p>
