<h2>wattribute</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a code for a characteristic
attribute of a window. This metalanguage symbol occurs as an expression
that evaluates to either one of the values <tt>"ACTIVE"</tt>,
<tt>"BCOLOR"</tt>, <tt>"COLOR"</tt>, <tt>"DEFBUTTON"</tt>,
<tt>"DISPLAY"</tt>, <tt>"EVENT"</tt>, <tt>"FCOLOR"</tt>,
<tt>"FFACE"</tt>, <tt>"FSIZE"</tt>, <tt>"FSTYLE"</tt>, <tt>"ICON"</tt>,
<tt>"ICONIFY"</tt>, <tt>"ID"</tt>, <tt>"ITITLE"</tt>,
<tt>"MENUBAR"</tt>, <tt>"MIN"</tt>, <tt>"MODAL"</tt>, <tt>"NEXTG"</tt>,
<tt>"PARENT"</tt>, <tt>"POS"</tt>, <tt>"PRESOURCE"</tt>,
<tt>"RESIZE"</tt>, <tt>"SCROLL"</tt>, <tt>"SIZE"</tt>,
<tt>"SIZEMIN"</tt>, <tt>"SIZEWIN"</tt>, <tt>"TIED"</tt>,
<tt>"TITLE"</tt>, <tt>"TYPE"</tt>, <tt>"UNITS"</tt> or
<tt>"VISIBLE"</tt>, or to an implementation-specific value (starts with
<tt>"Z"</tt>), or to an application-specific value (starts with
<tt>"Y"</tt>).</p>

<p>Modifed in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>Added <tt>"PTYPE"</tt>, <tt>"TBCOLOR"</tt> and <tt>"TFCOLOR"</tt> as possible
values for window attribute codes.</p>

<a name="wevclass"></a>
<h2>wevclass</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the name of an event class.
Possible class names may be <tt>"COMM"</tt> (events related to devices),
<tt>"HALT"</tt> (events that are generated when processes
terminate), <tt>"IPC"</tt> (events communicated by other
processes), <tt>"INTERRUPT"</tt> (events that are generated when
a process is interrupted in an implementation-specific fashion),
<tt>"POWER"</tt> (events generated when loss of electrical power
is imminent), <tt>"TIMER"</tt> (events that are generated when a
timer's waiting time has elapsed), <tt>"USER"</tt> (events
that are generated through the <b>ETRIGGER</b> command)
and <tt>"WAPI"</tt> (events related to windowing).</p>

<a name="wident"></a>
<h2>wident</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a name in the context of any windowing
activity. Such a name consists of alphabetic characters and digits and may
start with a % sign.</p>

<hr>
<a name="windowtype"></a>
<h2>windowtype</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a code that identifies the type of a
window. This metalanguage symbol occurs as an expression that evaluates to
either of the values <tt>"APPLICATION"</tt> or <tt>"MTERM"</tt>, or to an
implementation-specific value (starts with <tt>"Z"</tt>).</p>

<hr>
<a name="wname"></a>
<h2>wname</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a name of a window. Names of windows
consist of alphabetic characters and digits and may start with a % sign.</p>

<p>For portability, the number of characters in the name of a window is limited
to 31 characters.</p>

<hr>
<a name="writeargument"></a>
<h2>writeargument</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an occurrence of an argument of the
<b>WRITE</b> command. Examples of valid arguments for the <b>WRITE</b> command
appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>WRITE</b> command is
either one of a list described below, or an indirection operator (<tt>@</tt>)
followed by an expression that evaluates to a list (separated by commas) of
such arguments.</p>

<p>A directly specified <b>WRITE</b> argument can be a format specification, an
expression, or an asterisk followed by an expression.</p>

<p>Addition in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>A format specification can also be a reference to a device control function
(see the metalanguage symbols
<a href="m.htm#mnemonicspace"> mnemonicspace</a> and
<a href="c.htm#controlmnemonic"> controlmnemonic</a>.</p>
