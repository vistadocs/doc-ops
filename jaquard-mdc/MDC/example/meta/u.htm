<h2>useargument</h2>

appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>USE</b> command is either
an expression, optionally followed by more expressions (separated by colons),
or an indirection operator (<tt>@</tt>) followed by an expression that
evaluates to a list (separated by commas) of such arguments.</p>
