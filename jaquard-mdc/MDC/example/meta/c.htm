<h2>cattribute</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a choice attribute. Such a choice is
identified by an expression that evaluates to one of <tt>"ACCELERATOR"</tt>,
<tt>"ACTIVE"</tt>, <tt>"AID"</tt>, <tt>"EVENT"</tt>, <tt>"MARKER"</tt>,
<tt>"SEPARATOR"</tt> or "SUBMENU", or is equal to an implementation-specific
value (starts with <tt>"Z"</tt>), or is equal to an application-specific value
(starts with <tt>"Y"</tt>).</p>

<p>Modifed in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>Added <tt>"RESOURCE"</tt> as a possible value for choice attribute codes.</p>

<hr>
<a name="charcode"></a>
<h2>charcode</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the an identification of a key on the
keyboard. This symbol occurs as an expression that evaluates to the
identification of one of: a single key that is not a comma, the string
<tt>"COMMA"</tt>, the name of a function key, or an implementation-specific
value (starts with <tt>"Z"</tt>). This list is optionally preceded by a list
of modifier-keys (separated by plus-signs). If there are any modifier-keys,
there is a plus-sign between the name of the last modifier-key and the name of
the key that is being modified.</p>

<hr>
<a name="chars"></a>
<h2>chars</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a sequence of zero or more characters.</p>

<hr>
<a name="charset"></a>
<h2>charset</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the name of a character set.</p>

<p>The initial definition of <u>charset</u> allows
only <a href="i.htm#ident">ident</a> characters and digits.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>More characters are allowed in the name of a character set.
The first character may be a <tt>"%"</tt>, and <tt>"-"</tt>
(hyphen), <tt>"_"</tt> (underscore), <tt>"%"</tt>, <tt>"*"</tt>,
<tt>"."</tt>, <tt>"/"</tt>, <tt>"+"</tt>, <tt>":"</tt>,
<tt>"$"</tt>, <tt>"!"</tt> and <tt>"@"</tt> are added to the list
of allowable characters.</p>

<hr>
<a name="charsetexpr"></a>
<h2>charsetexpr</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an expression that
evaluates to the name of a character set.</p>

<hr>
<a name="charspec"></a>
<h2>charspec</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a "pattern range". A pattern range
is indicated by a specification enclosed in square brackets.
Such a specification looks like
either a single constant, or two constants separated by a colon.
A <a href="s.htm#strconst">constant</a>, in this context, is
either a string literal, or a reference to the intrinsic function
<b>$CHAR</b>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="ckeyword"></a>
<h2>ckeyword</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an expression that evaluates to the value
<tt>"CHOICE"</tt>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="closeargument"></a>
<h2>closeargument</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an occurrence of an argument of the
<b>CLOSE</b> command. Examples of valid arguments for the <b>CLOSE</b> command
appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>CLOSE</b> command is
either an expression, optionally followed by a list of expressions (separated
by colons) enclosed in parentheses, or an indirection operator (<tt>@</tt>)
followed by an expression that evaluates to a list (separated by commas) of
such arguments.</p>

<hr>
<a name="colattribute"></a>
<h2>colattribute</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an expression that evaluates to the value
<tt>"COLWIDTH"</tt> or to an implementation-specific value (starts with
<tt>"Z"</tt>).</p>

<hr>
<a name="colkeyword"></a>
<h2>colkeyword</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an expression that evaluates to the value
<tt>"COL"</tt>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="color"></a>
<h2>color</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the specification of a color. A color
specification is an expression that evaluates to a list (separated by commas)
of three integer values; the first value represents the level of the red
component of the color, the second value  represents the level of the green
component of the color, the third value  represents the level of the blue
component of the color. Each level is an integer value
(0 <img src="leq.xbm"> value <img src="leq.xbm"> 65,535).</p>

<hr>
<a name="commacode"></a>
<h2>commacode</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol occurs as an expression that evaluates to the string
<tt>"COMMA"</tt>. This symbol is used in lists, when a comma is needed as a
character in a list element, while the comma-character would act as a list
element separator.</p>

<hr>
<a name="command"></a>
<h2>command</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the general syntax of a command.</p>

<p>Note that for all commands (except <b>FOR</b>), a certain equivelance holds.
Assuming that "verb" replaces the actual command name:</p>

<p><center><tt>verb arg1 verb arg2 verb arg3 ...</tt></center></p>

<p>is defined to be equivalent to</p>

<p><center><tt>verb arg1,arg2,arg3,...</tt></center></p>

<hr>
<a name="commands"></a>
<h2>commands</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1984 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents one or more commands.</p>

<hr>
<a name="comment"></a>
<h2>comment</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a segment of source code that is ignored
while executing a M[UMPS] program. A comment starts with a semicolon, which
must occur in a position where any M[UMPS] command could occur, and ends with
the "end of line" marker that designates the end of the line on which
the comment occurs. A comment may contain any printable graphic characters.</p>

<p>Note: the ability to use of tabulation characters in comments may be an
extension that almost all implementations offer, but it <b><i>is</i></b> a
non-portable extension.</p>

<hr>
<a name="control"></a>
<h2>control</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents any of the 32 ASCII/M control characters.
A control character can have internal code 0 through 31 or internal code
127.</p>

<p>To be modified in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>A control character is any character that matches the pattern code 1C.</p>

<hr>
<a name="controlmnemonic"></a>
<h2>controlmnemonic</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the name of a device control function. The
meaning and effect of device control functions is described in the definition
of the <b>mnemonicspace</b> (function library) of which these control
functions are a part.</p>

<p>A <b>controlmnemonic</b> can start with either an alphabetic character or a
question mark (<tt>?</tt>); any further characters should be alphabetic
characters or digits.</p>

<hr>
<a name="CR"></a>
<h2>CR</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the special character "Carriage Return".
Since this character is normally not visible in printed text, the
representation CR is used in the ANSI M[UMPS] language standard to indicate
that this special character is present in a specific location.</p>

<p>Starting from the 1990 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard, this symbol is spelled
as <b>CR</b> (underscored).</p>

<hr>
<a name="cs"></a>
<h2>cs</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1984 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the white space between commands. This
amount of white space between commands may be one or more space characters.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard:</p>

<p>Spaces may occur at the end of a line.<br>
<tt>___<b>SET</b>_X=1___<b>WRITE</b>_"Hello."___</tt></p>

<hr>
<a name="curstr"></a>
<h2>curstr</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the value of one of the
directives of the FORMAT library function. The value represented
by this metalanguage symbol is the "currency string", a string that
is used to display the name of a currency at the appropriate
place in the formatted result.</p>
