<a name="M"></a>
<h2>M</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1994 ANSI GKS - M[UMPS] language binding.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an array of which the elements meet a
certain constraint.</p>

<p><b>v1</b> ::= <b>M</b> <b>gksnam</b> means: an array
<b>v1</b>(1),<b>v1</b>(2),<b>v1</b>(3), ... of which the elements each contain
a value that evaluates to a name that meets the constraints specified in the
GKS standard.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mant"></a>
<h2>mant</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a mantissa. A mantissa looks like either
one or more digits, optionally followed by a period followed by one or more
digits, or a period followed by one or more digits.</p>

<p>This means that valid mantissas are:</p>

<p><tt>123.456<br>
.456<br>
123</tt></p>

<p>but not</p>

<p><tt>.<br>
1234.</tt></p>

<hr>
<a name="marker"></a>
<h2>marker</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a code that identifies a method of
highlighting elements on a display. This metalanguage symbol occurs as an
expression that evaluates either to one of <tt>"M,BULLET"</tt>,
<tt>"M,CHECK"</tt> or <tt>"M,DIAMOND"</tt>, or to a value that identifies an
external resource.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mergeargument"></a>
<h2>mergeargument</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an occurrence of an argument of the
<b>MERGE</b> command. Examples of valid arguments for the <b>MERGE</b> command
appear in an earlier section. The argument of the <b>MERGE</b> command is
either a name of a variable, followed by an equal sign (<tt>=</tt>), followed
by a name of another variable, or an indirection operator (<tt>@</tt>)
followed by an expression that evaluates to a list (separated by commas) of
such arguments.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mkeyword"></a>
<h2>mkeyword</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an expression that evalates to the value
<tt>"M"</tt>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mname"></a>
<h2>mname</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the name of a menu. Names of menus consist
of alphabetic characters and digits and may start with a % sign.</p>

<p>For portability, the number of characters in the name of a menu is limited to
31 characters.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mnemonichar"></a>
<h2>mnemonichar</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the ampersand character ("&").</p>

<hr>
<a name="mnemonicspace"></a>
<h2>mnemonicspace</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the name of a mnemonicspace. A
mnemonicspace is a library containing functions for controlling a specific
class of device or file. Such a library may or may not be bound to another
standard.</p>

<p>Currently the only known mnemonicspace is <tt>"X3.64"</tt>, which is the
ANSI standard that offers the VT-100 compatible terminal controls.</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>New mnemonicspaces are:</p>

<p>...</p>

<hr>
<a name="mnemonicspacename"></a>
<h2>mnemonicspacename</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the syntax for names of mnemonicspaces. A
name of a mnemonicspace must start with an identifier character (see the
metalanguage symbol <a href="i.htm#ident"> ident</a>
and may be followed by zero or more
characters that are identifier characters, digits, periods (<tt>.</tt>) or
hyphens (<tt>-</tt>).</p>

Approved for addition in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>The name of a <a href="#mnemonicspace">mnemonicspace</a> may
also be a specification of a "portable mnemonicspace". Such a
specification looks like a caret, followed by the name of a
routine, optionally followed by another caret and the name of
another routine. The name of the first routine in this context is
the name of the routine that will be executed to process <a
 href="c.htm#controlmnemonic">controlmnemonics</a> in this
mnemonicspace.
If a second name of a routine is specified, and a routine of
that name exists on the current environment, this is intended
to be the a user-written routine to be used instead of the
(default) first routine.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mnemonicspec"></a>
<h2>mnemonicspec</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the mnemonicspaces that may be in effect
for a certain device or file. This specification is either an expression that
evaluates to the name of one mnemonicspace or a list of such expressions
(separated by commas) enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<hr>
<a name="modaltype"></a>
<h2>modaltype</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a code for the extent to which a window
with the MODAL window attribute defined disables other windows. This
metalanguage symbol occurs as an expression that evaluates to either one of
<tt>"ANCESTORS"</tt>, <tt>"APPLICATION"</tt> or <tt>"PARENT"</tt>
or to an implementation-specific value (starts with <tt>"Z"</tt>).</p>

<hr>
<a name="modifierkey"></a>
<h2>modifierkey</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's
Interface.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the name of a keyboard key that modifies
the meaning of other keys. This symbol occurs as an expression that evaluates
to one of the values <tt>"ALT"</tt>, <tt>"ALTR"</tt>, <tt>"COMMAND"</tt>,
<tt>"COMPOSE"</tt>, <tt>"COMPOSER"</tt>, <tt>"CTRL"</tt>, <tt>"CTRLR"</tt>,
<tt>"OPTION"</tt>, <tt>"SHIFT"</tt> or <tt>"SHIFTR"</tt>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="MTERM"></a>
<h2>MTERM</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>Application windows are the basic input/output mechanism of the MWAPI.
Application windows can contain elements.</p>

<p>MTERM windows are terminal emulation windows that accept M[UMPS] input/output
commands. The creation of MTERM windows is reserved.</p>

<hr>
<a name="mumpsreturn"></a>
<h2>mumpsreturn</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the return value of the
function <b>$MUMPS</b>. Such a value consists of three substrings,
separated by semi-colons. The first substring is an integer
numeric value, the second is an error code ("S" followed by a
number), the third piece may be any descriptive text (not
containing commas or semi-colons).</p>

<hr>
<a name="mval"></a>
<h2>mval</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents any value that has the
data type MVAL, i.e. any string value.</p>
