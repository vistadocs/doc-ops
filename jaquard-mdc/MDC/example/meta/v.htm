<h2>V</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1977 ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a constraint. Typically, this symbol
occurs following a general symbol (e.g. <b>expr</b>), and is followed by a
more specific symbol. The sequence "general" <b>V</b> "specific"
is to be read as: take the "general" thing, but limit its options to
those of the "specific" thing.</p>

<p>E.g.:<tt><b>expr V</b> "CHARACTER"</tt> means "an expression that evaluates to
the string value <tt>"CHARACTER"</tt>". (Sounds like: choose any color, as
long as it is black, doesn"t it...)</p>

<hr>
<a name="VB"></a>
<h2>VB</h2>

<p>Approved for inclusion in a future ANSI M[UMPS] language standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents the special character "Vertical bar"
("|"). This metalanguage element is used to avoid confusion between the
metalanguage symbol that implies an choice list with the actual character.</p>

<hr>
<a name="versionid"></a>
<h2>versionid</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an identification for a specific version
of an implementation of a windowing platform. This identification can be any
sequence of characters.</p>

<hr>
<a name="vkeyword"></a>
<h2>vkeyword</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents an expression that evaluates to the value
<tt>"VALUE"</tt>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="vpos"></a>
<h2>vpos</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a numeric value that indicates the initial
vertical location in a window. The unit of measure for this value depends on
other, related, specifications.</p>

<hr>
<a name="vpos1"></a>
<h2>vpos1</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents  a numeric value that indicates the
initial vertical location in a window in the context of a drawing command
(BOX, LINE or OVAL). The unit of measure for this value is determined by the
value of the UNITS element attribute for the gadget in question.</p>

<hr>
<a name="vpos2"></a>
<h2>vpos2</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents  a numeric value that indicates the final
vertical location in a window in the context of a drawing command (BOX, LINE
or OVAL). The unit of measure for this value is determined by the value of the
UNITS element attribute for the gadget in question.</p>

<hr>
<a name="vscale"></a>
<h2>vscale</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a numeric value that is used to apply
vertical relative scaling.</p>

<hr>
<a name="vsize"></a>
<h2>vsize</h2>

<p>Introduced in the 1995 ANSI M[UMPS] Windowing Application Programmer's Interface
standard.</p>

<p>This metalanguage symbol represents a numeric value that specifies the
vertical dimension of an entity. The unit of measure for this value depends on
other, related, specifications.</p>
