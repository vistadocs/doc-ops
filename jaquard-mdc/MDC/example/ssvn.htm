<h1>Structured System Variables</h1>

<p>Structured system variables (<u>ssvn</u> in metalanguage
terminology) behave like global variables when used as parameters
of the functions <b>$DATA</b> and <b>$ORDER</b>. When used in
arguments of <b>SET</b>, <b>MERGE</b> and <b>KILL</b> commands,
their behavior is different: either such usage is not allowed,
but if it is allowed, there usually is a side-effect that is
specific for the structured system variable in question.</p>

<p>In general, the structured system variables provide a directory
for a specific aspect of the M[UMPS] language. In a number of
cases, the structured system variables are used to manipulate
'meta-information' about the entities that are described in
them.</p>

<p>Names of structured system variables may be returned by
references to the function <b>$QUERY</b>. In such cases, a "canonic"
form of the name will be returned, in which all parts that may be
abbreviated are spelled out fully, and in which all parts that
are case insensitive are spelled in upper case only.</p>
