<b>2. Introduction</b><p>
These bylaws are for the purpose of extending and clarifying the
Constitution of the MUMPS Development
Committee; with no intent of conflicting with or circumventing
it. Therefore, the bylaws are to be interpreted in
the spirit of the Constitution, and, in the event of apparent
conflict, the bylaws are submissive to the
Constitution.<p>

the maintenance and monitoring of structural definitions for
structured system variables, and library
elements.<p>

A list of the allocation of names is to be made available on
request to any person by the MDC Secretariat.
The initial set of elements to be registered is as documented in
X11/SC10/91-3, as amended by the

framework and specifications for addressing the areas
of System Facility Interfaces, Internationalization and Security
within MUMPS systems. Other areas may
be added as directed by the MDC.<p>

In the area of System Facility Interfaces, the Subcommittee is to
include consideration of the
specifications produced by the IEEE POSIX committee.<p>

<li>To control the specification of all issues related to
devices which are either, not specific to the type of the
device, or whose usage is not within the Scope of Work of another
Subcommittee.<p>

<li>To produce technical reports as appropriate to the
areas of work of the Subcommittee for publication by
the MDC.<p>

<li>To recommend changes to the MUMPS Language
Specification, Bindings to it, or other documents
produced by the MDC as a result of the work of the
Subcommittee.<p>
