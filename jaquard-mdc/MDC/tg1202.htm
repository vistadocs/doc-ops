<ol>

<li>MDCCs recognized as such under the rules specified in
the MDC Constitution or any ISO/IEC member
body may register Character Set Profiles with the MDC by
submitting an English language copy of the
Character Set Profiles to the MDC, in addition to any referenced
documents and the minutes of the
meeting that approved the document, together with its English
translation.<p>

<li>A Character Set Profile registered by such a body may
not supersede an existing Character Set Profile,
unless that Character Set Profile has already been registered by
the body in question.<p>

<li>The body registering a Character Set Profile commits
itself to the maintenance of the Character Set
Profile. All subsequent versions of the Character Set profile
must be registered with the MDC.<p>

<li>If such a body ceases to exist, or does not respond
to inquiries from the MDC concerning requested
revisions of a registered Character Set Profile within six
months, the MDC may assume the responsibility
for the maintenance of the Character Set Profile.<p>
