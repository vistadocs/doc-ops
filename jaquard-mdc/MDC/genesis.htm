<h1>The Genesis of MUMPS and MUG</h1><p>

<i>When Glen Steinbach accepted the position as Chair of the
MUMPS Users' Group in 1985, he delivered the text on the following
pages as his maiden-speech. I've often seen parts of this
reproduced; here is the complete text.</i><p>


<h2>The Genesis of MUMPS and MUG<br>
<i>by Glen Steinbach</i></h2><p>

In the beginning was the sky, and woods, and COBOL. And Octo Barnett looked
out over the lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and said, "I will have a
computer system for this lab." And contracts were let and work began.<p>

But this was the time of Assembly Language and early COBOL, and the Lab System
needed better tools. Three young software shepherds named Pappalardo, Greenes
and Marble heard a calling and followed it to the basement of the Hospital.
There, in the corner of the animal lab, stood a PDP-7, and the creation of a
new software system began.<p>

The three shepherds obeyed new and unwritten commandments:<p>
<ul><h3>
<li>Thou shalt not declare variable types or file sizes.<p>
<li>Thou shalt not KILL, except for globals and variables.<p>
<li>Thou shalt not covet they neighbor's UCI.<p>
<li>Remember string handling, for it shall make MUMPS special.</h3><p>
</ul>
They worked for six days and six nights, and as the sun rose on the seventh day
there was MUMPS writing data with dazzling speed to the PDP-7's DECtape. On
the seventh day MUMPS ran, the shepherds rested and Octo saw that it was good.
And the year was 1966.<p>

The lab system at Massachusetts General was completed and word of this new
MUMPS spread throughout the land. Federal grant money was awarded to
MUMPS-based projects, and copies of the system were distributed. And at the
appointed time, Pappalardo and Marble formed Meditech, Greenes formed
Automated Health Systems, and thus MUMPS was commercially available. And the
year was 1969.<p>

And it came to pass that there was much demand for information about MUMPS,
and these requests were directed to Octo Barnett. Octo asked Barbara Farquhar
to help provide information, and thus the idea of the MUMPS Users' Group
began.<p>

<hr>

<b>So begins the Book of Farquhar.</b><p>

It was during this period that the first quarterly publications of MUMPS
information were mailed. And Octo said, "We shall have a meeting", and so it
was to be. In December of 1972, forty disciples gathered in Boston, thereby
beginning the ritual known as the Annual Meeting of the MUMPS users' Group. So
the MUMPS community grew, a few COBOL programmers took note, and at the
appointed time Farquhar begat Joan Zimmerman.<p>

<hr>

<b>The Book of Zimmerman.</b><p>

It was during the time of Zimmerman as Executive Director that the use of
MUMPS and membership in MUG grew rapidly. Dr. Gwylim Lodwick became the first
formal Chairman, to be followed after two years by Dr. Richard Walters. The
faithful gathered for Annual Meetings in distant lands such as St. Louis,
Denver, Washington DC and Madison, Wisconsin. And there was good news and bad
news in the continuing development of the language. First, the good news
numerous groups around the country were enhancing the language. Now the bad
news   they were all working independently so the numerous versions of MUMPS
very rapidly becoming entirely incompatible. Thus, the MUMPS Development
Committee was born to guide the development of the language. With the help of
Ted O'Neill, Marty Johnson and numerous others, a standard for the language
was adopted by the Committee in <p> 1975 and accepted by the American National
Standards Institute in 1977. And at this time Zimmerman begat Richard
Zapolin.<p>

<b>The Book of Zapolin.</b><p>

<i>As Zapolin started his three year term,<br>
Rothmeir took over as Chair,<br>
And both of them worked to make MUG good,<br>
For the many MUMPS users out there.<p>

MUG met in Boston in '77,<br>
San Francisco in '78.<br>
The next year the meeting was held in Atlanta,<br>
And attendance grew at a fast rate.<p>

It also happened at this time,<br>
That Ted O'Neill joined the VA.<br>
With Marty Johnson close behind,<br>
The "Underground" was there to stay.<p>

Their battle climaxed in '82,<br>
When Congress did decide,<br>
That MUMPS would be the language of choice,<br>
For VA centers nationwide.<p>

The next MUG Chairman named Heffernan,<br>
Was elected in '79.<br>
A Jesuit priest who speaks and writes well,<br>
His guidance of MUG was divine.<p>

The year was 1980 when<br>
His era came to a close.<br>
Zapolin begat a doctor named Dayhoff,<br>
And this psalm returns to prose.</i><p>

<hr>

<b>So begins the Book of Dayhoff.</b><p>

Soon after the age of Ruth Dayhoff began, storm clouds formed on the horizon
of MUG. This was to be a time of bizarre, calamitous and unexpected
happenings. MUG's management company lost records, produced unreliable
accounting data, and then sued the organization. The balance sheet looked
bleak, with liabilities in excess of assets. All this was capped off with the
Annual Meeting in Niagara Falls, which featured scantly-attended sessions,
dark and damp rooms, and a business meeting that ended in chaos. The truth
will never be known, but some have been heard to say that the highlight of
this meeting was the site visit to Love Canal.<p>

Was this the end of MUG? Not if Dayhoff has anything to say about it! As times
grew tougher, Ruth worked harder. Richard Walters became the new Chairman (for
the second time) and the MUG office was moved from Boston to Washington.
Maureen Lilly was hired as Administrative Director, marking the beginning of
the MUG office staff. The quality of the MUG Quarterly improved and, after a
successful meeting in Denver, the future of the organization looked
brighter.<p>

And the MUG staff   well, they were fruitful and multiplied. For a while it
seemed that everyone on the office staff was pregnant, including both Maureen
Lilly <b><i>and</i></b> Ruth Dayhoff. The 1983 Annual Meeting in San Francisco
featured a record number of attendees, even though the cable cars were not
running. Four-week-old Joseph Lilly attended with his mom and spent much of
this time in the room with a nun hired to babysit (who, on one occasion as
Joseph cried, was heard to exclaim, "C'mon, Joseph, give the sister a
break!")<p>

It was at this time that Dayhoff moved on to the position of Chair, and begat
Helmuth Orthner as Executive Director.<p>

<hr>

<b>The Book of Orthner.</b><p>

The age of Orthner, which continues to this day, has been a time of prosperity
for MUG. Membership has grown and the 1984 meeting in Philadelphia was the
biggest ever. The quantity and quality of MUG publications continues to
improve. The competent office staff provides a multitude of services for
members. And with the generosity of DEC and InterSystems, MUG now even has its
own computer in the office. Of course, there have been some set-backs. The
long-discussed Continuing Education Seminars were sponsored throughout the
land, and although planned with much prudence, they've not had many students.
But not all plans can turn out well!!<p>

<hr>

<b>And what is the final Revelation of this all?</b><p>

<i>As this story ends at this time,<br>
I'll change from prose back into rhyme.<p>

Now as I assume the position of Chair,<br>
I think MUMPS prospects are better than fair.<p>

And why do I think that MUMPS will do well?<br>
'Cause I've programmed in COBOL and know that it's hell.<p>

And although other database systems sound neat,<br>
In features the FileMan has everyone beat.<p>

So be glad you know MUMPS and perhaps you've agreed,<br>
MUMPS is a good tool that can help you succeed.<p>

In conclusion I must say I'm glad that you're here.<br>
So you can be part of this good book next year.</i><p>
