<h3>by Ed J.P.M. de Moel</h3>

<p>There probably is an announcement elsewhere in this issue of
<i>M Computing</i>: the publication of <i>M[UMPS] by Example</i>
is finally a fact.</p>

<p>It is now about four years since I started on this book, and I
still don't feel that it is "complete", and maybe it never will
be. I did feel that it was important to have some form of the
book generally available, though.</p>

<p>This is not a book to read &quot;cover to cover&quot;.
Instead, it is more like a dictionary, itemizing all aspects of
M[UMPS]-related issues, grouped by functional category, in
alphabetical order (well… the section on error numbers is in
numeric order, and the section on special characters ins in order
of ASCII code, but one gets the drift easily). The book is
intended to answer questions like:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>How do I use this function?</li>
<li>Does it have any other uses?</li>
<li>Has this always been as it currently is, or did it change
with the last standard?</li>
<li>What exactly are the changes that are introduced by the
various new iterations of the standards?</li>
<li>M[UMPS] now has five ANSI standards, how do they work
together?</li>
<li>What is to be expected from the &quot;next&quot;
standard?</li>
<li>For questions of clarification that people asked in the
context of the canvass process, what is a good way of making the
answers to these questions generally available?</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Some of these questions are answered more than completely in
this new book, and some only partially or not at all. I hope it
will be less than another four years before the next edition of
this book will appear in print.</p>

<p>[ And... if you have examples that you would like to contribute
for a future edition, or if you have questions that you would
like to see answered,
please <a href="mailto:demoel@jacquardsystems.com">e-mail</a> them
to me. ]</p>

<h3>ANSI today... tomorrow the world</h3>

<p>Last summer, ANSI gave their final approval to the standards
that were canvassed in 1994 and 1995, and last fall, ISO
announced their intent to conduct a &quot;fast-track&quot;
procedure for the Language Standard, the Open M[UMPS]
Interconnect Standard and the M[UMPS] Windows Application
Programmer’s Interface.<br>
Keep an eye open for announcements in the international press!</p>

<h3>Subcommittees</h3>

<p>It is often said that committees ask for seconds, keep minutes
and waste hours. In some sense, this is probably true for the MDC
as well.</p>

<p>Something else that committees tend to do is create large
amounts of sub-committees (and the sub-committees create
sub-sub-committees, et cetera). Until about a year ago, the MDC
had five subcommittees. Currently, there are &quot;only
three&quot;. Does this mean that the committee is losing its
impetus? I don’t think so. The subcommittees that have ceased to
exist are still there in a way: the groups that worked on the
windows API and networking have completed the most
labor-intensive part of their work and are continuing on as
sub-sub-committees of the subcommittee called
&quot;Environments&quot; (actually, the MDC calls such a
sub-sub-group a &quot;task group&quot;).</p>

<p>But there are a couple of new projects that have started, and
I would not be surprised if there were suggestions to channel the
work for these efforts through new subcommittees.</p>

<h3>Brave new language</h3>

<p>The main &quot;new idea&quot; is to start looking more at the
future than at the past. Rather than &quot;fixing&quot; the
existing language and inserting modern constructs like
&quot;Object Orientation&quot; into a body that is still
hesitating to complete the transition from &quot;Turing State
Orientation&quot; to &quot;Stack Orientation&quot;, the thought
is to start work on a new language has gained acceptance. The new
language would carry forward the desirable aspects of the current
one and does not have the limitations that impede progress on the
introduction of new concepts.</p>

<p>Is there indeed a marketplace for this brave new language that
has such beautiful syntax in it, or could it be that the
installed base of existing software is important enough that a
new language is an exercise of academic interest only?</p>

<p>Within the next few meetings, the future of this effort will
be decided. It is time to gather input from the community at
large to find out where &quot;our best interests&quot; really
are. So, once again, if you have an opinion that you wish the MDC
to consider, do let us know. Write to the secretariat, or attend
our meetings!</p>
