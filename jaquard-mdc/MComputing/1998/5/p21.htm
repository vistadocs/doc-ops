<p>Wow!  I'm actually in my office when it's time to write a Questing column.
Since I wrote the last column, the MDC has not met, and no earth-shaking
developments have occurred, so I think I'm caught up on the news. What I
want to do this time is ask you for help.</p>

<p>At the last meeting (September, 1998 in Seattle), the MDC voted to hold at
least one meeting next year (1999) electronically, if suitable technology
could be found. It was left up to the chairman (me) and the Executive
Committee to determine what "suitable technology" might be. I've managed to
come up with a list of features for such a product, with a ranking from
necessary to window-dressing. What I'd like is to hear from you about
software you've used or heard about that might meet our needs. Who
knows-maybe this will even inspire one of you to produce a great product!!</p>

<p>In general, the features are listed in decreasing priority order, though the
first three features (price, platform and throughput) are not "present" or
"absent" features.</p>

<p><b>Price</b>: Obviously, less is better here. Each member institution spends
somewhere around $1,000 per meeting in airfare, hotel bills, meals, meeting
fees, etc., sometimes more, sometimes less. A price of up to $1,000 per
member institution is, therefore, worth considering, anyway.</p>

<p><b>Platform</b>: On what computers does this technology run? PC's are available for
most people. Some folks will want Macs (though probably relatively few
M'sters). Unix boxes and VMS machines (VAXes and Alphas) would also be nice.
What is the minimum speed/version, etc. required by the software? What
special equipment is required (microphones, cameras, etc.)?</p>

<p><b>Throughput</b>:  If this software will work over a 14.4KB modem, just about
everybody should be able to use it. If it requires ISDN or T1 connectivity,
many people may be out of luck. Something in between seems reasonable.</p>

<p><b>Speaker Identity</b>: Each "speaker" should have their identity show every time
they speak. Anonymous comments are not appropriate in an MDC meeting.</p>

<p><b>Moderated Speaking</b>:  Ideally, the "chairman" of the meeting should have to
grant permission for each person to speak. Individuals can send requests to
the chairman, who then grants speaking permission (perhaps for a fixed
period of time) to those who make requests. Requests should queue up as
needed. Our members are used to this sort of parliamentary procedure, and
it is occasionally necessary to prevent interminable discussions and
sidetracks.</p>

<p><b>Document Download</b>:  In addition to providing the meeting forum, there should
be a mechanism to download documents related to the meeting. This could be
handled separately (with an FTP site), if necessary, but it would be nice if
documents could be easily downloaded without leaving the meeting forum.</p>

<p><b>List of Participants</b>: It is necessary to know who is present for the minutes
and to determine if a quorum has been established. We could poll the known
members, but it would be much easier if a list of current participants could
be generated.</p>

<p><b>Transcription</b>:  A transcript of the session should be generated. This will
be indispensible when it is time to prepare the minutes of the meeting. The
transcript must identify the speaker as well as what is said. It should also
include other information generated by the meeting software (whiteboard
data, list of downloadable documents, voting results, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Controlled Membership</b>:  People should not get speaking privileges (at least)
without permission of the chair. This is in keeping with the meeting rules
laid out in the MDC Constitution. It is unlikely in the extreme that
permission would be denied, but it must be controlled to retain continuity
from meeting to meeting.</p>

<p><b>Whiteboard</b>: This can take two forms. A "text only" board would be fine.
This would be a separate window (or similar partition) on which one person
at a time can write and which is displayed for everyone to see independent
of the discussion. This is useful for displaying agendas, lists of pros and
cons, straw polls, etc. In some software, the whiteboard allows graphics,
which extends this to allow the "scribe" to draw pictures, too. Occasionally
that is useful.</p>

<p><b>Whispering</b>: This is where one participant can talk privately to another
participant. These "whispers" are not sent to anyone else (including the
chair) and are not part of the transcript. This is useful, but not
critical.</p>

<p><b>Voting</b>: If the meeting software allows people to vote easily, this could
speed the process. If not, roll-call votes can be used. It would be nice to
be able to do a quick "show of hands" vote, but this is not essential.</p>

<p><b>Audio</b>:  If people can speak into a microphone and be heard by everyone, as
opposed to typing, it might be nice, if only to get inflection. Doing this
would narrow the range of platforms and would eliminate such features as
transcription, so it might be more of a loss than a gain.</p>

<p><b>Video</b>:  Like audio, it gives more of the feel of a real meeting, but at the
expense of requiring more and costlier equipment and greater throughput.
This is probably purely window-dressing.</p>

<p>So, what technology do you know of that matches this list of requirements?
If you have some ideas, please send me some

call me (573-882-2666). Thanks in advance for your help!!</p>
