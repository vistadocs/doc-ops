<h2>Web-based Skill Testing
for Computer Professionals</h2>

<h3>by Bill Lake</h3>

<p>TekMetrics has developed a new web-based technical skills screening system
called 123Assess. With this tool, companies can remotely screen job
applicants' technical skills in over 40 high-demand technical disciplines,
including M, C++, COBOL, Oracle, HTML, and Java.</p>

<p>The system allows applicants to complete a customized job-application
online, submit their resume and complete up to 5 technical skills
assessments. All of the information is stored in an applicant tracking
system, and because it is web-based, it can be retrieved by authorized
hiring managers at any location.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Recruiting professionals build a 123Assess Profile based on the job for
which they are hiring. The Profile may include a customized job application,
resume capture, and up to 5 skill assessments. You can even tell the system
to offer the applicant a choice of assessments from a list you design. For
example, you could have the applicant choose from a list of object-oriented
languages, because you realize the skills translate easily to your
environment no matter which they chose.</p>

<p>Example: You create a Profile called Web-Developer. It is assigned a PIN
code that you give to candidates who want to apply for the job. They visit
the web site www.123apply.com and type in that PIN. The web site welcomes
the applicant to your company's application system and collects the
application and resume information, and administers the assessments.</p>

<p>The results are scored immediately and provided to the applicant and to the
hiring manager or recruiter, literally before the applicant leaves his
chair.</p>

<p>All of the results are stored in a secure database that serves as an
applicant tracking system. "Because it is web-based, a recruiter at a
college job fair can track their candidates in real-time, attach notes to a
record, send an email to the candidate, or forward a record to a hiring
manager," said Mike Littman, Vice President  Operations. The system provides
filter, search, sort and query functions that allow you to see the
applicants you are interested in. These functions work for all data,
including the application information, the resume information and the
assessment scores.</p>

<p>"The number one obstacle executives face in achieving their corporate goals
is finding and retaining the people with the skills who can take them there.
Unfortunately, when it comes to technical skills such as C++, COBOL, Oracle,
HTML, Java and many other skills, there are few people in the hiring process
who can really determine the applicants' skill level. Even if we know what
questions to ask, hiring managers often don't know how to evaluate the
answers. Using assessment tools in the past wasn't a viable solution because
it would take too long and place too much of a burden on the applicant.
Well, now there's a new option," said Mike Russiello, president of
TekMetrics. "You see, TekMetrics technical assessments are all designed to
take only 10 minutes. They take less time to complete than a technical
interview, and they provide a far better gauge of a person's skill.
Recruiters and hiring managers have the results within seconds of
completion."</p>

<p>The 123Assess assessments take only 10 minutes (and often times much less)
because they use computer-adaptive-testing (CAT). CAT assessments are smart;
they adjust to the test-taker. The system is testing for the person's
maximum skill level, but avoids questions that are too easy or too hard
based on the test-taker's previous answers. This approach is very accurate
and fast and is becoming more popular today. In fact the SAT's we took in
high school are being converted to CAT.</p>

<p>"A screening tool will be far more effective if it measures what the
employee will do on the job. That's why our assessment questions focus on
real-life examples of problems that are solved in the workplace. Many of our
assessment questions include sample code and ask the applicant to correct an
error, or complete the code," said Mike Littman, Vice President Operations.
"We have a team of over 100 top-notch subject matter experts developing and
validating the assessments to ensure their quality and exactness."</p>

<p>TekMetrics, a Virginia-based company was founded by 3 partners who all
worked in the technology market but grew frustrated with the inability to
fulfill customer needs. "Every technical engineer knows that their
visibility and value increases substantially by exaggerating their knowledge
of a high-demand skill such as Visual Basic, C++, or COBOL. Hiring managers
know this, but until now, had little capability to accurately screen the
candidate's skills. When they couldn't perform on the job as expected we
would lose money and sometimes we'd lose customers," said Russiello.</p>

<p>Many companies turn to assessments to reduce their turnover costs. Industry
analysis estimates turnover costs to be in the range of 25% of a person's
annual compensation and benefits. Russiello said, "Many of our customers see
it as a way of shortening the hiring cycle. In the technology market this
can be a competitive advantage. By providing all of the information needed
to make a hiring decision in one session, the recruiter or hiring manager
can decide more quickly, with confidence. If that decision is to hire, they
can beat the competition to the better candidates."</p>
