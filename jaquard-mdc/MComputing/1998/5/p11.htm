<h2>M Market in China: Opportunities
and Challenges</h2>

<h3>by Feng Huang</h3>

<p>M is making a name for itself in the Asian market. After opening
successfully in Korea in 1997, M was introduced into Thailand in February,
1998. The greatest Asian market, however, is China, where its influence has
not been widely felt, despite earlier efforts (See "Features of M Required
in China: Insights from Translating FileMan" by Feng Huang, M Computing Vol.
2, No. 5 Nov. 1994). The purpose of this article is to introduce the
situation with respect to marketing M in China based on personal observation
and past experience.</p>

<h3>Early Efforts in M Implementation in China</h3>

<p>There have been several occasions when the time appeared ripe for M to be
introduced to China. Hospitals were beginning to recognize the need for
computerized information systems. With guidance from Professor Richard F.
Walters, the first Chinese MUMPS was introduced. Soon thereafter, with
assistance from Dr. D.B. Shires, then Chair of IMIA (the International
Medical Informatics Association), DSM was made available to a single Chinese
hospital in Beijing at The Oncology Hospital of the Academy of Medical
Sciences of China, using a PDP-11/23.</p>

<p>There were, however, two barriers to continued expansion of the use of M in
China. First, all available M systems at the time ran only on mini or
mainframe computers, which were not generally available in China. The second
problem related to processing Chinese characters in M: many people believed
(erroneously) that M could not deal with the Chinese characters, and this
impression remains in the minds of many technicians in China today.</p>

<p>A second opportunity for introducing M to China came in the early 1990s.
Earlier, in the latter half of the 1980s, the database package dBASE III had
become widely used in China, with a great many applications based on that
package. However, users were beginning to recognize limitations in this
package. Furthermore, Ashton-Tate (the developer of dBASE) merged with
Borland; to the Chinese mind, this meant that dBASE would cease to exist,
and another package must be found to replace it. This led to a search for
other options. At the same time, a project was included in China's National
Five Year plan, the eighth such plan of the Chinese government. Oracle,
Foxpro, and M were selected as targets for investigation for a national
hospital information system. Work started at the People's Hospital of
Beijing Medical University, and Data- Tree M (DTM) was used to implement a
Chinese version of the VA FileManager (Huang, 1994). This work was done
independent of DataTree's direct involvement. In 1993, four Chinese experts
attended the 22nd Annual MUMPS Users' Group meetings in Washington, D.C. One
of their assignments was to discuss closer cooperation between DataTree
management and the Chinese representatives. It appeared as though, with help
from DataTree, M would come to China at last. However, no sooner had this
agreement been reached when DataTree merged with InterSystems, as the
Chinese delegation learned while still in the United States. Again, because
of mistrust of mergers, the M project was terminated, and a second
opportunity to bring M to China was lost.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation</h3>

<p>After the termination of efforts to introduce M as a part of the eighth
Chinese National Five Year Plan, the two remaining contenders, Oracle and
FoxPro, also failed to meet expectations and were abandoned. Instead, SQL
Server with PowerBuilder was selected as the platform on which to base the
Chinese hospital information system. This project was completed in March,
1997. The system was developed in the People's Hospital of Beijing Medical
University. Despite many problems, this system is running today and is
considered the best hospital information system in China. The total
development investment for the hospital was 6 million yuan ($700,000), with
a research investment of 10M yuan. (Editor's note: The author informs us
that the average personal income in Beijing is 11016 yuan, approximately
$1,327 per year.)</p>

<p>The success of this Chinese Hospital Information System (CHIS) seems to
imply that there is no room for other systems to be introduced. However,
that is not the case. CHIS has increased interest in HISs in general,
demonstrating that, with sufficient investment, a good hospital information
system can be developed. However, CHIS would probably not be adopted in many
other hospitals because of its deficiencies, which include a relatively low
productivity for the investment, lack of flexibility and poor messaging
capability. As a result, Chinese technicians are actively searching for
other alternatives at this time.</p>

<p>In addition to the demonstrated success of CHIS, other factors in the
general situation in China are encouraging hospitals to build computer-based
HISs. In 1997, there were about 10 million personal computers.</p>

<p>Their cost is low enough that even individuals can afford them. This also
means that they are cheap enough for hospitals to establish HISs based on
PCs.</p>

<p>Another factor that encourages development of HISs is support from the
government. In 1995, the Chinese national government established a "Golden
Health Engineering" or a "National Health Information Building Engineering
Project." Its goal is to organize and encourage building information systems
and networks. This information system would apply not only to hospitals, but
also to such programs as public immunology, oncology, etc.,—in other words,
to impact all sorts of health delivery systems.</p>

<p>When CHIS became a reality, many hospitals and companies started to develop
their own systems. One such system, the General Army System, was developed
in cooperation with Hewlett-Packard Corporation. This system was declared to
have been successful, and the Chinese Hewlett-Packard Corporation has
already begun to market their HIS packages, POPHIS V2.0.0 and INFORMED
V1.0.0. Their total investment is greater than 10M yuan.</p>

<p>Another well-known system in China is that of the Beijing Hospital, which
developed a system in collaboration with IBM's Chinese subsidiary. This
system, with a total investment of 6M yuan, succeeded in building an HIS in
the first affiliate hospital of the China Medical University, with an
installation investment of 10M yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, this same system has been installed at the first hospital of Jiang
Su province. Many experts and administrators consider it one of the best
systems.</p>

<p>Up to the present, more than ten large-scale hospitals and approximately 100
medium-scale hospitals in China have developed or have started to develop
their own hospital information systems. Other hospitals are beginning to do
so. There are over 700 hospitals in China with bed capacities over 500 beds,
so the market is large. With this great a demand, the opportunity arises
again for M to participate.</p>

<p>Unlike the situation in earlier years, software is now copyright protected
in China. Several lawsuits have demonstrated this fact, so it appears that
software developed would be protected. This means that the development
efforts of individuals and companies interested in building complex software
systems would be protected. People are aware of copyright provisions, and
they also recognize that software development costs may exceed the cost of
hardware necessary to run these systems. They are much more selective in
software purchases as a result.</p>

<h3>How to Enter the Chinese Market</h3>

<p>The greatest barrier for M in the Chinese market is that there is no current
M-based hospital information system in the country at this time. There have
been many lectures and seminars on M in China attended by technicians. These
people are aware of the potential of the language, but they need a sample
system to study in greater detail so that they can persuade their management
that M is international, not just English, in its focus. Many people believe
that a sample demonstration M-based HIS is the only way to gain acceptance
for M in China. Other problems exist, such as the lack of M programmers and
lack of Chinese documentation etc., but these problems could be solved more
easily if a demonstration system were available. The best way to get started
would be for some group to collaborate with a large hospital or other unit
to build a test HIS of MIS with M. A careful implementation plan is needed.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There is a real market for M in China. The interest is there, and anything
seems possible. M vendors should make a strenuous effort to capitalize now
on this favorable situation. It is not without risks and challenges, but the
potential reward is great.</p>
