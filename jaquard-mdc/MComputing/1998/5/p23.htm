<h3>by Ed J.P.M. de Moel</h3>

<p>Things happen, and when they do, certain questions are asked
over and over. There are some that I have heard quite a lot of
times over the past few months. What will happen to M[UMPS]? What
will happen to the MTA? What will happen to the MDC? What will
happen to Civilization As We Know It?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that the future will tell, but some
details are already becoming apparent.</p>

<h3>The MDC</h3>

<p>Let's start with the question about the MUMPS Development
Committee. That is one for which the answer seems to be rather
evident. The MDC started its work in 1972 when there were over a
dozen competing dialects of a language that was later
standardized, and further developed. Currently, there are still a
number of language processors left: DSM, MSM and Cach&eacute;
obviously lead the market, and there are also DTM, Plus5, GTM,
CCSM, M-Global, UC-Davis MUMPS, Gerum Standard MUMPS, and the
Russian , the Brazilian Extensao MUMPS and a couple of Japanese
implementations . I haven't actively worked with the latter ones
recently, so I don't know how close to the current standard these
are, but these products still seem to satisfy a part of the
market. Talking to people at the various gatherings that I
attend, it continues to surprise me how many people still use
these products, and how well these implementations still fulfill
the needs of their end-users.</p>

<p>So, if any estimates are to be made about the division of the
market, and how the market demands might influence activities of
the MDC, I would say that the main reason for existence of the
MDC is no longer present: there are no longer competing dialects
of the language and there are no longer competing plans for
extensions to the language. Also, I see that some customers would
rather stick with the implementation of the language with which
they are currently working, and are not moving to other
implementations that are closer to a more recent version of the
ANSI and ISO standards. And so, it has become obvious to me that
these extras are not the prime interests of those customers.</p>

<p>In short, I think that I don't need to read any obscure
entrails to predict the future of the MDC: after a long and
fruitful life, the committee has reached the point where the
burning need for its work is no longer present. I foresee the
completion of the "millennium version" of the standard for the
programming language (X11.1), I foresee ratification of the
current working documents of OMI and MWAPI (X11.2 and X11.6). I
foresee that there will not be renewed versions of the bindings to
GKS and X-Window<SUp>TM</SUp> (X11.3 and X11.4).</p>

<p>I foresee that the millennium versions of X11.1, X11.2 and
X11.6 will probably be the final incarnations of these standards,
and that the committee will discontinue work on the issues
related to these standards.</p>

<p>So what is left? The only other work before the MDC is the work
on X11.7, currently probably better known as "Omega". As yet,
there is no implementation of the concepts that are intended to
be included in this standard, and I have seen no announcements
from any implementor that they are working on an implementation.
I would be surprised if the enthusiasm for "Omega" as an
intellectual excercise could keep the committee alive.</p>

<h3>M[UMPS]</h3>

<p>For the second question, "What will happen to M[UMPS]?" I
foresee a much brighter future. Time and again, it is shown that
the technology that once was known by this name offers a
price/performance ratio that other technologies simply cannot
rival. I was still living in Europe when we were stunned by the
fact that a major player in the MUMPS market there (and chairman
of the Swiss national MUG) "dropped out", because his management
forced him to switch from MUMPS to "a relational database". I am
extremely happy to see that his department now has reverted back
to "the fold" because the performance that they needed (and were
used to) could simply not be achieved otherwise. </p>

<p>So, activities to teach the language, activities to support
tools that enhance the capabilities of the language, activities
that support the maintenance of products created in the language,
for all of those, I foresee that there will be an increasing
need, especially while the market continues to expand.</p>

<h3>The MTA</h3>

<p>I am writing this column on my way back from the annual meeting
of MTA-Europe. By the time that this column appears in print, it
will probably no longer be any news that MTA-Europe decided to
dissolve itself at this meeting. Does the demise of the European
organization spell a similar future for the other MTAs? I don't
think so. After all, there are quite a number of organizations
that have the terms MTA and MUG in their names, and issues that
spell trouble for one organization may benefit the other.</p>

<p>MTA-Europe felt that the strength of the various national
organizations was sufficient that there was little or no interest
left to support an European parent organization. The national
organizations, however, are still there, and will continue to
meet. Even while the MTA-Europe was discussing the procedural
activities that would be required to dissolve the "umbrella"
organization, the same people were planning future meetings of
their national organizations.</p>

<p>The largest organization is MTA-NA. For this organization, I am
afraid that I do need to resort to ESP, or other occult
techniques, to predict a future. The increasing market for
products that are based on M[UMPS] should increase the viability
of the MTA, and yet, the membership of the MTA, just like any
other user group, is decreasing and will probably continue on this
path.</p>

<p>Being a member of the MTA Board, I am, of course, one of the
people looking at what we might do to increase, or at least
stabilize the membership.</p>

<p>The MTA currently produces this journal, sells other M[UMPS]
related literature, maintains a database with information about
M[UMPS] related employment openings, maintains a web-site, and
organizes the annual meeting.</p>

<p>It used to be that the annual meeting was a major source of
income for the organization, but the current trend is that people
obtain more information from "the web", and have much less need
to travel to meetings where implementors display their products.
In the past, such exhibitions were the only chance to obtain
product information, but this function of annual meetings is no
longer there. By providing "links" from the MTA web-site to the
web-sites of the various implementors, consultants, employers and
tools vendors, the MTA provides an important part of the benefits
that the membership expects, but has also lost a significant part
of the need for annual meetings.</p>

<p>The reduced interest in annual meetings does mean that the MTA
will have to expand its services, or else be prepared for the
situation where all income comes from membership fees and
advertising in M-Computing. I have already heard the comment that
members feel that the only tangible return they see for their
membership fee is the journal, and that they don't find that
enough to justify the expense. So there is a strong indication
that, if nothing changes, membership could even decrease more
rapidly than just because of the reduced interest in annual
meetings.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this issue, I expect to see an article by the
MTA-Board as a whole, where future plans for the organization are
discussed in more detail.</p>

<p>For the local user groups, the future is probably a whole lot
sunnier. After all, membership in these organizations typically
involves a fairly low annual membership fee (to cover postage and
pizza), and the travel for their get-togethers is by definition
local.</p>

<h3>And Further?</h3>

<p>For myself, there have been some changes since last June. After
leaving Micronetics, I was pleased to see how many jobs there
were to choose from (hence some of my sunny predictions). I was
even more pleased to find a job that I really enjoy without
having to relocate. I am currently employed by Jacquard Systems
Research, and I am on contract with the Veteran's Administration
in Silver Spring, where I have joined Ruth Dayhoff and Peter
Kuzmak on their Imaging Project.</p>

<p>For the other collegues who used to work for Micronetics, I
have heard are that they all "landed" pretty comfortably, and
most did not have to leave the M[UMPS] world.</p>

<p>So, in short, the Titanic <b><i>IS</i></b> still afloat and I
expect that it will continue to float for quite a while. I know
it's not unsinkable, but if there is an iceberg up ahead that
will cause the demise of M[UMPS] related technology, that would
come as a complete surprise to me.</p>
