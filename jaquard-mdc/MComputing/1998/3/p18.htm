... every problem can just as easily be considered an opportunity."</h2>

<p>Editor's Note:
<i>The following interview was taken from a web page version
published by M-B&ouml;rse, the magazine published by MUG-Germany. The editors
of M Computing have made a few minor grammatical and word usage changes to
the text, but the context is unchanged.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Richard ("Dick") Walters, Professor of UC Davis, who happened to be in
Frankfurt/Germany immediately after InterSystems had announced their
takeover of Micronetics on Friday, June 19th 1998, was interviewed by the
journal of the MUG Germany immediately after the announcement.</p>

<p>M-B&ouml;rse was represented by Dr. Wolfgang Kirsten, now chairman of MUG
Germany, and Wilhelm Pastoors, one of the coeditors of M-B&ouml;rse. Since we
believe that what Dr. Walters said in the interview may be of interest to
the M Community, we decided to publish the interview on the net.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: projects like LINUX, FreeBSD, PERL, gcc - to name just a
few -- demonstrate that there are other non-commercial ways to achieve really
efficient computer systems. When will the IT World see "freeMumps"?</p>

<p>Dr. Walters: At this point, given the announcement we heard an hour ago, I
can't give you a direct answer. I can speculate, though: there are two
directions that the M community might go. One is to say we have only one
commercial vendor, that commercial vendor does not support the MDC and the
statement that they published about the acquisition of Micronetics doesn't
even mention the MDC. They feel that MDC moves too slowly for the commercial
market, as they stated in their document.
So, there are two things that might happen: one is that MDC will die; the
other is that the M community will say we can't let that happen, since M
cannot evolve with the name Cach&eacute; replacing M and becoming a commercial
product, not an ISO standard.</p>

<p>There are many computer scientists who have worked with the M language who
feel that it is a major contribution and would like to stay a part of that
evolutionary process. If the M Community decides to try to preserve the M
standard, there are again, two options.</p>

<p>The first is to support the remaining commercial versions or to help develop
potentially new ones; the second is to support a public domain effort that
might lead to several versions of M and its global handler. These two
options are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they could easily be addressed
in parallel.</p>

<p>Let's consider the second option first.</p>

<p>Some years back, a small group formed a distributed partnership that we
called Generic Universal MUMPS, or GUM for short. There were about four or
five contributors, including LD Landis, a former student of mine (Terris
Linenbach), Steve Morris, Dr. Cui Zhang (a Computer Science professor at
Sacramento State University), myself and others.</p>

<p>GUM has been led mainly by LD Landis, but it has been housed on a UC Davis
ftp site (and will soon be on another web server at UC Davis). This project
got as far as completing a working version of a "Global Handler," that is to
say, an implementation of the M global structure in such a way that data
could be stored in a MUMPS structure, with the functionality of creating and
modifying globals and manipulating them via $ORDER, $DATA, $QUERY, and $GET.
The GUM team intended also to implement an M compiler so that all language
elements, not just the database, would be available in a public domain
version.</p>

<p>GUM has not yet achieved its goal of implementing a compiler, but the global
handler has gone through some improvements, a process that is continuing.
With the Intersystems announcement, interest in GUM has heightened
considerably, and the M community needs to ask itself: is this a viable way
for us to proceed today?</p>

<p>I don't know the history of the PERL language but it would be an interesting
one to explore because PERL came out of nowhere. Five years ago there was no
PERL. Now there is PERL on almost every machine. There is even a user's
group meeting scheduled this Fall. How did that happen, what could we learn
in the M community that might make us want to try to apply this model in the
evolution of M?</p>

<p>I have set up the web page for GUM code to be downloaded from a server at UC
Davis. I offer this to the M community as a way to provide software using
freeware models like GNU or BSD (details remain to be worked out). I think
that such an effort is worthy of support, and I hope that people in the M
community will join in seeking grant support for people to develop versions
of M to place in the public domain.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: You stated that the global handler is too slow.</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: No, what I said was that earlier M implementations at UC Davis were too
slow to serve as starting points for a new M compiler. We had several
versions of MicroMUMPS running on a good many different machines, but their
performance was much slower than existing M implementations of their time,
and the code was written using a technique that was cumbersome. Another
implementation of M by a student at UC Davis generated P code which was then
interpreted. This version also proved to be orders of magnitude too slow to
serve as a base for the present effort.</p>

<p>Actually, the GUM global handler is quite fast, certainly fast enough for a
public domain version.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: What is a global handler?</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: In M, the term "global" refers to what in other languages is referred to
as persistent data. Global variables are stored after a program that
created them halts, and they can be shared by multiple users. (M "local
variables" are the equivalent of global variables in other languages, in
that they are available to all procedures running in a workspace.)</p>

<p>The GUM global handler creates a B-Tree structure of the hierarchical M
globals, storing them using the same "canonic" sorting, based on numerics,
then ASCII code values to sort string subscripts. This structure
outperforms relational model joins, as has been shown in many studies. GUM
allows globals to be created and modified, and it also allows them to be
retrieved using the functionality of standard M functions such as $ORDER,
$DATA, and $QUERY. With these functions, I can work with M-type data, but I
don't need other M commands (besides the equivalent of SET and KILL). I can
use a C call to $ORDER and go out and get my data - implicitly persistent
data - from a C call that goes to the global handler. So in the M language
the concept of persistent data is independent of the concept of the
interpreter.</p>

<p>When I say that we have a global handler I say that we have a database that
is fully functional but I don't have the MUMPS commands, operators, and
other features that are part of the language.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: A part of the LINUX project was that different universities
coordinated an effort in which their computer science students created
various parts of the total system. So from different universities came
different parts that contributed to the whole project.</p>

<p>Now, the Frankfurt University Hospital supports Mumps, through the efforts
of people such as Prof. Giere and Dr. Kirsten -- could you imagine that there
might be a coordinated action by - for example -- the departments of
informatics at Frankfurt University and UC Davis and other universities . .
. to get some more support for the realization of the idea of a free mumps?</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: I am not sure -- I think that today's announcement will act as catalyst for
actions of this type, but probably involving a much broader segment of the M
community.</p>

<p>One of things what LINUX has in its favor is that LINUX is UNIX based. UNIX
is taught in computer science departments around the world. Historically,
when Bell Telephone first developed UNIX, they sold it for $20,000 to
businesses as an operating system . They also sold a license to the entire
University of California for about $150 for unlimited licenses. In other
words: they gave it away to the educational world saying "it is yours, you
can go develop it, you can work with it however you want, here is the
source code, have fun!" BSD is one outgrowth of that effort. As a result,
UNIX became the principal operating system taught and used in computer
science departments around the world, and with time it gained a larger share
of the commercial marketplace as well.</p>

<p>MUMPS, on the other hand, ran on dedicated computers with a proprietary
operating system, and computer science departments were not willing to
dedicate an entire computer just to M. As a result, there has been little
interest in the M language in computer science departments. A few
individuals, such as Kevin O'Kane (then at the University of Tennessee) and
my group at UC Davis developed public domain versions of M, but there were
very few.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: So, we can see that the computer scientist base for developing an
M Database is much smaller than it was for LINUX. We have to go by personal
contacts. The situation is that Frankfurt University Hospital supports Mumps
very actively, and there may be a chance to make personal contacts to the
department of computer informatics at [Goethe] University in Frankfurt to
show what's going and maybe there is one professor who might say: "ok, I
will support it, I will direct my students to work on that project." We have
to build a net of such people.</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: . . . Yes, I think that the Goethe University has a very good potential
to serve as such a center. I hope we can interest others in this effort as
well. The GUM project started as a distributed effort, and even if I retire
in a couple of years, it should be able to continue without me.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: But you are the person identified with the GUM project. Who is
the owner of GUM?</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: The University of California is because of me. Not because I did it but
because I got people to get started on it. It has a life of its own. I also
think that M is important and I don't want to see it die. I'm willing to put
an administrative effort into it, and it is a working model at present. But
I cannot contribute to the actual compiler development. That would require
help from groups and institutions such as Goethe University and the growing
members of the GUM team.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: At the moment situation is that there are only a few active
members of the group. If we could find a few more to join, it would
significantly improve the situation, right?</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: Yes. All of these people have their other jobs, I don't think they have
had time during the past two years to work on the compiler. It takes an
extra effort, an extra incentive to say: "right, instead of going home and
playing with my children I'm going to stay for an extra 5 hours and work on
the compiler". That's something that may happen, we may get people,
especially after today's announcement.</p>

<p><b>M-B&ouml;rse</b>: Just to get an idea of the effort involved: how much work has to
be done? There is a lot of overhead created when a software product is
manufactured for the commercial market. Sales Representatives, technicians
who install and support, consult. Just to break it down: how many people do
you think work at Micronetics or Intersystems departments of development?</p>

<p><b>DW</b>: I truly don't know. Not a large percentage of the total group in any
one company. I have heard that Micronetics had two lead developers and
about 18 others working on various versions. DSM, so I understand, had about
seven working on the system, and DTM perhaps a few less.</p>

<p>I think we might be able to get enough people to develop one or more public
domain compilers. With the incentive we now have, many people are saying:
we can't let this happen, we can't let Mumps die, I think we can have a
version that was operational for the MDC to start to work with in less than
a year. And that assumes that we have a leader who knows something about it,
and who can assign to other people different parts of the parsing, the
lexical analysis and so on, I think that could be done. It looks as though
we do have such a leader willing to head the team (LD Landis), so we are
off to a good start.</p>
