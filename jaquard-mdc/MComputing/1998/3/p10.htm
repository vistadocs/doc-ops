<h2>The MTA's own Y2K Problem</h2>

<h3>by Don Gall</h3>

<p>On behalf of the entire membership of the M Technology Association, I want
to thank John Covin for all of the work that he has done and his excellent
leadership of this organization for the past seven years. I am very grateful
that the bylaws of the MTA will keep John on the Board of Directors during
my tenure as Chair. The other board members and I will continue to rely on
his intelligence, experience and common sense.</p>

<p>I would also express my appreciation to Richard Davis and Gregg Seppala, two
board members who will not be returning but who contributed greatly to this
organization. Susan O'Gorman and Ed de Moel, who are newcomers to the board
but who have already demonstrated many years of dedication to the MTA, will
be welcome additions. I want to also thank Dave Lenhart for his interest
and efforts and for being a candidate for the board.</p>

<p>In the past two years, the Board of Directors and the superb staff of the
MTA have improved the financial condition of our organization. After two
consecutive years of losses, we now have a fund balance greater than it was
two years ago. This was accomplished in spite of continued loss of
membership and continued declining attendance at our annual meeting.</p>

<p>To this scenario we must add the changes that will be inherent in being part
of an industry dominated by a single vendor. Micronetics has been an
important member of our community for many years. Now they, like DataTree
and DEC before them, will be assimilated into the InterSystems family of M
products. What will this mean to the MTA and the MDC and the entire M
community?</p>

<h3>What role should the MTA play in the next years?</h3>

<p>John Covin has expressed the current role of the MTA very succinctly, "The
role of the MTA is to provide a forum for the M community." Should this
role change? I don't think it should. The M community consists of the M
vendors, the M developers, the M programmers and the M users. To the extent
that this community has common goals, common problems, common educational
and training issues and common expectations, the MTA should provide a forum
for discussion, education and resolution of all of these common issues.</p>

<h3>Are there good reasons for M to continue to exist as an ANSI Standard
Language?</h3>

<p>The literature is full of articles about the decreasing role of
committee-determined standards. At a time when technology is moving so
rapidly, the de facto standard is being set by the leaders. Bill Gates
continues to set more standards than he adopts. This is not a question that
the MTA Board of Directors will decide. In the end, InterSystems, the MDC
and the M developers will decide it.</p>

<h3>What will be the role of the MDC in an industry dominated by a single
vendor?</h3>

<p>The answer to this question is quite obviously related to the answer to the
previous question. As a long-time software developer, I can attest to the
fact that we can become very myopic without a significant amount of input
from the community we serve. I would hope that the MDC would continue to
have an influence on the future development of the M language.</p>

<h3>What happens to the MTA Annual Conference?</h3>

<p>During the Association meeting at the recent MTA Annual Conference, a straw
poll of the attendees produced two messages: (1) associating with a larger
meeting, such as we have done for the past three years, is a good idea and
(2) a desire for decreasing the cost of attending the meeting. At the board
meeting held in conjunction with the recent MTA Annual Meeting, it was
decided to look for another software conference with which we might
associate. If the MTA staff can not find a good fit, we will, at least for
the coming year, opt for a stand-alone meeting at a location somewhere in
the central U.S. with lower hotel rates than are available in a city such as
Boston.</p>

<h3>What actions can the MTA take and what benefits can we provide the
membership to revitalize an interest in both membership and annual meeting
attendance?</h3>

<p>In a larger sense, it will not matter whether there are five M vendors or
one if the membership and annual meeting attendance continue on their
current path. Extrapolation of the trends of the past five years clearly
shows that we will no longer be a viable organization by the year 2000. This
is the M Technology Association's Y2K issue.</p>

<p>Amidst the gloom and doom, there is a bright side to life in the M
community:

<ul>
<li>The M market is growing.</li>
<li>The demand for M programmers is growing.</li>
<li>M databases continue to outperform all other commercially available
databases.</li>
<li>M databases have been successfully adapted to object oriented technology.</li>
<li>M databases have been successfully integrated with a number of levels and
types of Windows technology.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>All of this is happening while the number of MTA members and the attendance
at the annual meeting are both declining. What is wrong with this picture?</p>

<p>Our problems are not unique. Technology is now changing too quickly for
anyone to wait for an annual meeting to find out what is going on. The
Internet has played its role in decreasing the attendance at many
conferences. There are numerous instances in which you can get better
information from a web page than from the brochures you pick up at a
conference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are few better ways to learn about a subject of
your immediate interest than to attend a well-structured seminar or ask
questions of a panel of people who have already done what you need to get
done.</p>

<p>In a sense, the product that the MTA has been producing for the M community
has either not been good enough or has not been marketed properly. "Sales"
are going down. We must build a product that is of greater value and we must
market it better. To this end, the board of directors welcomes any and all
suggestions from you, the MTA User's Group if you will, to help the MTA
achieve these goals.</p>

<p>The MTA has resources within the M community that no one M vendor or no one
M developer can match. We need to marshal those resources to build a
product that will increase membership and increase the attendance at our
meetings. If we do not meet this challenge, the MTA's Y2K issue will get us,
and the M community will be the poorer for it.</p>
