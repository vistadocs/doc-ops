<p>The largest topic on comp.lang.mumps this month has been the InterSystems
acquisition of Micronetics' assets. There have been multiple threads dealing
with the topic:

<ul>
<li>What's the future????</li>
<li>New worlds to conquer?</li>
<li>MTA meeting status</li>
<li>Message from InterSystems</li>
<li>The new American dream</li>
<li>MSM-WS &gt; Cach&eacute;?</li>
<li>Micronetics</li>
<li>DTM to Cach&eacute; conversion</li>
<li>MSM WS buried</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The following posts and excerpts are pretty much in chronological order</p>

<p>Dan Baer: What's the future????</p>

<p>It's a logical move for InterSystems. Why not dominate your market?
Eliminate your greatest competitor and your market share increases
dramatically overnight.</p>

<p>Seems like Micronetics should have gone public and used the capital to
increase their market share, or perhaps to have purchased Greystone.</p>

<p>Will the small, independent M developer be forgotten about, unable to bring
inexpensive, M-based products to the general computing marketplace (COTS &amp;
shareware)? If InterSystems abandons the MSM systems (like they did with
DTM), and don't redesign Cach&eacute; so it has an extremely small footprint (like
MSM-Workstation gives us), small developers will have no way to use M for
their products. They'll be forced to use alternative technologies. Is M now
headed for just large, corporate installations with licensing prohibitively
high? Will developers be able to continue to create and distribute royalty
free M applications?</p>

<p>What about M? Who knows. Maybe a new company will be founded with the
personnel that have been displaced and customers that may be forgotten
about. Maybe there's an M that would be developed and supported by the
community like LINUX. Or maybe Microsoft comes in with their own M system.
Or an even greater possibility, after InterSystems locks in the M market,
InterSystems is bought out by Microsoft so MS can have a strong foothold in
healthcare information systems.</p>

<p>Dan Baer: What's the future????</p>

<p>As an independent developer that has released products that use M to
customers that don't even know about M, I am a bit nervous. I was forced to
move from InterSystems DTM to MSM since DTM would not work under NT with
their Visual M server. This was a few years back, and as far as I know,
that is still the way DTM is. To me, this shows that IS has placed their
greatest portion of development on Cach&eacute; and has let other systems stagnate
and forced me, as a customer, to use their competitor's solution. As an
independent developer, this makes me wonder if I'll be able to count on
InterSystems for my development needs. So far, they still do not have a
solution for my use.</p>

<p>So, as M developers and users, we have some things that make us nervous.
Whether or not this was a good move for us, only time will tell. For
InterSystems, it was their obvious move. If InterSystems is successful in
positioning their Cach&eacute; product as an Oracle/Sybase killer, then it may be a
very positive thing for the M community (if there's an "M" community left).</p>

<p>James Allen Self: MTA Meeting Status</p>

<p>Everyone here is deeply concerned by InterSystems buyout of Micronetics and
wondering what that means to plans for upgrading and expanding our systems
and services. We are anxious to learn how this is interpreted by M people at
the meeting and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Your &lt;Ben Bishop's - ed.&gt; notes confirm my feeling that InterSystems is
focused strongly on non-M users to the point that they hardly see us any
more.</p>

<p>Although development directions in the VMTH are not immediately affected,
since we are building on Netscape, Javascript, and Java on the front end and
still have quite a bit of room for intranet growth with DTM on the back end,
it seems that our options for low-cost expansion and development of medium
and large-scale systems in M have been suddenly reduced so that we must
seriously consider alternatives.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in Open Source projects and products, such as
LINUX and Apache, and the possibilities of an Open Source M. Is it possible
for the GUM project or something like it to produce a MUMPS that could
reliably support an HIS? (see article beginning on page [] for more
information on GUM.)</p>

<p>I had been planning to install a test bed MSM-Server here but that seems to
be a dead end now.</p>

<p>Chris Blandino: Message from InterSystems</p>

<p>I don't think that the MDC appeared to be having too much effect on
InterSystems anyway. They had already developed products like Cach&eacute; Objects
and Cach&eacute; SQL prior to the Micronetics purchase. As far as I'm concerned I
think this acquisition will ultimately be a good thing for a number of
reasons:</p>

<p>1. There are tons of new cool things happening in Mumps, but until now I've
been unable to really use them because they weren't how the "other" vendor
might have implemented them (read: nonstandard).</p>

<p>2. The competition hasn't been eliminated-it has just changed. Instead of
Micronetics, its now Oracle, Sybase, Informix, etc. To be honest, these
companies offer SERIOUS competition which should really help to advance
InterSystems' product line as far as features go.</p>

<p>3. If InterSystems is smart, they aren't going to force us all to use
Cach&eacute;-Objects or Cach&eacute; SQL, but will instead allow us to continue to use
native M (Cach&eacute; Direct). After all, this should help to differentiate
InterSystems' products from their new competition and is after all what most
of us need to do for the majority of our work. Certainly if they did force
us to do this we would all be forced to consider alternatives like Informix,
Oracle, etc-and they certainly don't want us to do that.</p>

<p>4. Most M customers weren't actively participating in the MDC, and now
InterSystems won't be limited by their guidelines . . . they are a business
like any other and should be reacting to the needs of their customers
anyway- if they don't they won't have any customers.</p>

<p>5. M as a language hasn't really evolved that significantly as an ANSI
standard language anyway. OK, OK- we got the merge command and the somewhat
cumbersome MWAPI which was never fully implemented by InterSystems anyway. I
remember an InterSystems conference where Paul Grabsheid said that after
they had poured a lot of time and effort into implementing MWAPI, it turned
out no one wanted to use it-hence the development of Visual M.</p>

<p>This situation really isn't that different from any other out there in the
marketplace. Microsoft owns SQL Server and Visual Basic (I hate to think
where VB might be today if it had to wait for a standards body to approve
every change). Sybase and Powerbuilder are owned by one company, as are
Oracle, Informix, etc. Even languages like C aren't really that portable
(i.e., if you write C code for an MS Windows environment using the MFC it
ain't gonna run on a UNIX box or a MAC). In some ways I think we've missed
out on a lot of cool things because we've been tied to the ANSI standard as
the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p>Karl Fisher: The new American dream</p>

<p>Database programming is a business. Companies do what is in their on best
interests. You can either continue to cry a river of tears about the "good
old days," "the American dream," and "apple pie" or you can concentrate on
doing what is going to make you and your organization successful. I
guarantee that is what InterSystems is doing.</p>

<p>Its an old statement, but true. The only thing that is constant is change.
Those that are successful are those that embrace the change and look for
areas to expand. Not those that complain about what could have/should have
been.</p>

<p>msm4me@hotmail.com: The new American dream</p>

<p>Some of us actually chose to use M and chose to be a Micronetics customer
for various reasons. I chose to be a Micronetics customer because of their
products and service, and I object to being sold off to what I consider to
be a lesser company with inferior products-for my needs. Cach&eacute; may well be a
serviceable product, but I don't want a 50+ Mb install. MSM was the product
that suited "my" needs and did it very well indeed. Now that has all ended.</p>

<p>MSM user<br>
N.Z.</p>

<p>Dan Baer: MSM-WS &gt; Cach&eacute;?</p>

<p>I have no idea what IS plans on doing with MSM-Workstation. It would seem
to be a pity to abandon it. It was just getting to be a good product, not
only for M developers, but for the M community in general. We really needed
a product that could be released to the general programming community, not
just M programmers. MSM-WS was going to allow us to try to get non-M
developers interested in exploring M. But now, if it is an abandoned
product, I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about MSM-WS with developers.</p>

<p>I'm waiting for some response from InterSystems. I emailed their MSM hot
line and requested that they attend our MUG's July meeting. I haven't had a
response yet. Maybe I'll have to call.</p>

<p>Greg Kreis: Micronetics</p>

<p>I will miss the FANTASTIC Micronetics web site. The webmaster they
contracted with is AWESOME. Her creativity and graphics quality are some of
the best I have seen anywhere on the net.</p>

<p>Although it is hard to see this happen to the M community, maybe it will
indeed give InterSystems the "critical mass," as they mentioned, to make a
much greater dent in database sales around the world. I hope they are
extremely successful so our M skills will be of greater and greater value.</p>

<p>Chris Blandino: DTM to Cach&eacute; Conversion</p>

&gt;You *HAVE* been coding in Standard Mumps and avoided using implementation
specific functionality haven't you?</p>

<p>Man, that last statement is one I hope I don't have to hear too much now
that InterSystems has acquired Micronetics. I have always hated the fact
that I couldn't use some cool feature in one vendor's implementation because
it hadn't made it into the ancient standard! Standards bodies shouldn't
drive product development, customer needs should.
Gardner S. Trask III: DTM to Cach&eacute; Conversion
The great thing about the standard, the thing most people forget, is that it
allows for vendor extensibility, but in a standard way. There were
conventions to allow any command, any functionality a vendor could think up,
and have it implemented in a way that would not crush legacy code. If
InterSystems wanted to make blue toaster oven interfaces, no problem. And
then, if it was well received and adopted, it could very well become part of
the ANSI standard language. Never in a million years would I believe
DataTree or Digital or Micronetics or Greystone or InterSystems ever sit
around on their respective hands and wait for a standard to come out.</p>

<p>Chris Blandino: DTM to Cach&eacute; Conversion</p>

<p>To be honest I don't want to sit around and think up all the things that
might be good for the language, sometimes it's nice to be surprised by what
an ingenious vendor can come up with to help make a product more attractive
and give themselves an edge in the market. After all if everyone had Cach&eacute;
Objects or some other specific feature, it certainly doesn't give the
company developing it any kind of edge (or incentive to develop it in the
first place).</p>

<p>Gardner S. Trask III: DTM to Cach&eacute; Conversion</p>

<p>I agree. However, I want the pool of ideas to come from a host of companies
(vendors and users) all looking at this with different views and mindsets.
Each perspective adds to the final solution. I encourage competition and
free thinking. The standards body (of which I am not one) did not drag the
process, and one vendor will not save it.</p>
