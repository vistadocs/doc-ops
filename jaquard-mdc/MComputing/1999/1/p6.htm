<p><b><i>The most popular Web server software on the Net isn't made
by Microsoft. Or Netscape. It isn't made by any traditional
company at all. How'd that happen?</i></b></p>

<p>A red feather resting against the words "Powered by Apache":
On the Web, the logo is everywhere. And for good reason- the
Apache Web server, a piece of software that transforms ordinary
computers into sites on the World Wide Web, is by far the most
popular choice for Webmasters everywhere.</p>

<p>That fact alone is extraordinary. The Apache server is not a
commercial product- it is "freeware" hacked together by a loose
coalition of software developers stealing spare time from their
demanding day jobs. And yet, in a market niche targeted by both
Microsoft and Netscape as a crucial steppingstone to future
profits, Apache dominates- it is installed on almost half of all
publicly accessible Web servers. And not just because the price
is right, say Apache fans, but because it is a better product
than its commercial competitors faster, more reliable, more
up-to-date.</p>

<p>Market share isn't the only yardstick by which to judge
Apache. Its success pays tribute to the utopian ideals of the
whole "free software movement"- and testifies to the enduring
vigor of the Internet's cooperative, distributed approach to
solving problems. Never mind the buzzword-hyping marketroids
endlessly pushing the latest shrink-wrapped solution to all
software problems. The Net offers a better way, as even Apache's
competitors will concede- off the record.</p>

<p>"We think the Apache guys are way cool," says one Microsoft
employee who didn't want his name used. "We think they're at the
heart and soul of what the Internet is all about."</p>

<p>Ironically, despite Apache's prominence in a noncommercial
movement, it owes its birth in part to one of the first
capitalist encroachments upon the Web.</p>

<p>Back in late 1994, Brian Behlendorf, a young programmer fresh
out of UC-Berkeley's computer science department, was entrusted
with the task of setting up the Web site for HotWired, Wired
Magazine's first foray into online publishing. One of HotWired's
initial requirements was a registration system that required
passwords- a controversial concept at the time.</p>

<p>In those days, most Webmasters depended on a Web server
program developed at the University of Illinois' National Center
for Supercomputing Applications (also the birthplace of the
groundbreaking Mosaic Web browser). But the NCSA Web server
couldn't handle password authentication on the scale that
HotWired needed.</p>

<p>Luckily, the NCSA server was in the public domain, which meant
that the source code was free to all comers. So Behlendorf
exercised the hacker prerogative: He wrote some new code, a
"patch" to the NCSA Web server that took care of the problem.</p>

<p>He wasn't the only clever programmer rummaging through the
NCSA code that winter. All across the exploding Web, other
Webmasters were finding it necessary to take matters into their
own keyboards. The original code had been left to gather virtual
dust when its primary programmer, University of Illinois student
Rob McCool, had been scooped up (along with Marc Andreessen and
Lynx author Eric Bina) by a little company in Silicon Valley
named Netscape. Meanwhile, the Web refused to stop growing- and
kept creating new problems for Web servers to cope with. Patches
proliferated in an uncoordinated, hopscotch manner.</p>

<p>Behlendorf is a fervent believer in the possibilities for
cooperative software development on the Internet. He began to
contact the other programmers and suggest that they join forces
in rewriting the NCSA code. At first, the developers called their
stitched-together solution by the joke name "A PAtCHy server."
But by February 1995, they had completely rewritten the NCSA
program from top to bottom and formalized their cooperation under
the name "the Apache Group." Ever since, collaboration across the
Net has been the Apache watchword.</p>

<p>"Everything that we've done has been in a distributed manner,"
says Behlendorf. "There hasn't been one company, one person, or
one group of people that's controlled development."</p>

<p>Today, according to Netcraft, a British network consultancy,
49.7 percent of all publicly accessible Web servers on the
Internet run Apache- and the number keeps growing. (The program
runs mostly on Unix operating systems, though a new version is
now available for Windows NT.) Apache's proficiency at allowing a
single machine to host thousands of different virtual Web domains
has given it a commanding share of the Internet Service Provider
market. Yahoo runs Apache, as does the Internet Movie Database
and, not surprisingly, HotWired itself- although Behlendorf, now
the chief technical officer at the Web production studio Organic
Online, is long gone.</p>

<p>Apache's success is worn like a badge of honor by free
software enthusiasts, and touted endlessly as proof that the
Internet hasn't been utterly overwhelmed by voracious commercial
software titans like Microsoft.</p>

<p>"Apache is one of our great success stories," says free
software advocate Eric Raymond, author of "The Hacker's
Dictionary." "Everybody thinks so. And the Apache people see
themselves, with justification, as exemplars of free-software
culture."</p>

<p>But just what is free software "culture"? The free software
community is large and diverse, not to mention packed chock-full
of acronyms only a geek could love- GNU, Linux, FreeBSD, Perl. It
is riven by religious schisms and periodically explodes into
flame wars over technicalities that might strike the outsider as
enormously picayune. Still, despite their differences, free
software developers share the belief that their movement is not
only the Internet's past but its future.</p>

<p>"The Linux guys and the Apache guys and the Perl guys and the
W3C and the people hacking Internet standards at the IETF all
identify with each other, with the free software community in
general, as much or more than they do with individual projects,"
says Raymond. "I'm not an Apache developer, but I nevertheless
think of their success as 'ours' rather than 'theirs,' and they
feel the same way whenever Linux or GCC scores another design
win."</p>

<p>The first thing to understand about free software is that it
is not necessarily free. As legendary MIT hacker Richard
Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation and primary
coordinator of the GNU ("GNU is Not Unix") Project, likes to say,
"Free software is a matter of freedom, not price- the freedom to
modify the software, redistribute the software and release
improved versions of the software."</p>

<p>Such "freedom" basically means the ability to access- and
change- a program's source code. The typical software company
guards its source code like a pack of pit bulls standing watch
over crown jewels. Source code is considered the core
intellectual property upon which the software industry is built.
For example, Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser may be
free to consumers, but it is not "free software" - the source
code is under lock and key.</p>

<p>Source code availability is the great selling point, so to
speak, for free software (and, indeed, Behlendorf would rather
use the phrase "source-code available software" than "free
software"). The point is, if something goes wrong, you don't need
to wait around for Microsoft or Netscape to answer your support
calls. If you discover a bug or you need some new function, you
can just roll up your sleeves and start mucking about with the
code yourself. And more often than not, someone else already
encountered the same problem and posted a fix to the Net.</p>

<p>"Having access to the code and being able to modify it is
pretty key," says David Filo, co-founder of Yahoo. "It's just a
lot easier when you have total control over it."</p>

<p>However, there are different kinds of total control.
Stallman's GNU software is protected by a licensing system that
requires anyone who distributes modified versions of GNU software
to distribute the modified source code as well. This ensures that
each future generation of the software will always remain
open.</p>

<p>The Apache Web server, on the other hand, is protected under a
different, less restrictive licensing system that allows future
users to do whatever they want (as long as they include the
Apache Group's copyright notice). Already, several companies are
reported to be turning a profit with commercial versions of
Apache, most notably C2Net, an Oakland, Calif., software company
that sells Stronghold, an Apache Web server incorporating public
key cryptography.</p>

<p>Behlendorf goes so far as to argue that Apache's licensing is
"more free" because it places fewer restrictions on future users.
And he believes that this has helped the spread of Apache. But
such an approach is anathema to Stallman. If source code
availability isn't permanently protected, he argues, then the
software can ultimately be perverted by commercial pressures.</p>

<p>Stallman believes the right to free software is "inalienable."
To him, it's a moral issue; he doesn't care whether free software
produces better code or is embraced by consumers.</p>

<p>"I don't judge these things in terms of material benefit,"
says Stallman. "My fundamental reason for having a free software
community is so that I can continue to use computers without ever
doing something wrong- without ever promising that I won't share
with you. Even if most computer users don't choose to be in this
community, I can be in it. It's not a matter of whether one
philosophy or another wins the whole world. It's not an all or
nothing thing." </p>
