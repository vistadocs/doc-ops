Best Practices</h2>

<h3>by Pam McIntyre</h3>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to write a &quot;Best Practices
in Information Technology&quot; paper for a small, but well known
consulting firm. It was interesting to see what the business
world was doing with regard to not only new technology, but also
what it was doing to salvage &quot;old&quot; technology. A best
practice is generally defined as a practice that is used
successfully by the &quot;best&quot; companies to improve
productivity, increase cost-effectiveness, reduce time-to-market
... you get the idea.</p>

<p>I was not amazed to see what was being done with mainframe
computers, for instance. Many companies are using their
mainframes as web servers. Morgan Stanley allows its customers to
access their stock portfolios via the web and initiate any number
of transactions. The nice thing about mainframes, of course, is
that they were made for high-volume transaction-processing
applications. The two other uses just made for mainframes are data
warehousing and data mining because of the large databases
involved. Even better, the information derived from these
applications is increasingly important to the strategic
decision-making process meaning that those old systems may still
be able to pay for themselves.</p>

<p>Another not so surprising bit of information is the decreasing
interest in client/server technology. The complexity involved in
trying to get multiple platforms and operating systems and
applications to work together has turned out, in some cases, to
not be worth the effort and the increased amount of technical
support necessary to keep them running. I love the term
&quot;thin client.&quot; I equate it roughly with the term
&quot;dumb terminal.&quot; Who says history doesn't repeat
itself?</p>

<p>Best practices are dynamic. They are always changing.
Sometimes it is because there is a genuinely new circumstance to
deal with: doing business over the Internet, for example. But
mostly, best practices are common sense: selecting a model for
use in software development versus winging it; or using
cross-functional teams, another way of saying &quot;get everyone
involved who has a stake in the project.&quot; Just be aware that
what is best practice for one company may not be the best for
another. Remember that practices may come and go but common sense
will live on forever.</p>
