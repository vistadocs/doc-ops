<p>When we started scheduling features for the 1993 <i>M
Computing</i>, we felt that internationalization of the language
would be the primary focus of M Technology for the next several
years. Wanting to capitalize on the anticipated trend, we
spotlighted international concerns for our first issue this year.
This made sense to us since the MUMPS Development Committee (MDC)
was nearing completion of many key components to language changes
required for use by non-English languages. It seemed likely that
these features would be incorporated into the next standard
revision now under discussion and due for canvassing shortly.</p>

<p>Also, remember the news broadcast to our own organization at the
1992 Annual Meeting? The Gartner Group Consulting Services'
report to us pointed to a burgeoning worldwide market and
projected growth rates far beyond North America's opportunities.
In fact, outside our boundaries, M will double its influence and
will exceed the domestic income perhaps as early as 1994. Hence
our role as newsbreaker: we believed that the timing was right
to tell the M community that some good activities are already
afoot in the international marketplace and, perhaps more
importantly, to chronicle steps that even now facilitate
internationalization of our computer technology.</p>

<p>When I accepted the position of executive editor, I naively
assumed that all one need do to fill the technical pages of our
magazine pertinent to our selected topic was to put out the words
"International Commerce." But, the technical papers did not flood
the office. Consequently, it was an edifying experience to meet
with Marsha Ogden, our managing editor, and to find that
expectations and deliveries often do not match.</p>

<p>We had some articles ready for the issue, and some others that
were likely to be submitted. The breadth and impact I had hoped
for, however, was not complete. Phoning, faxing, and cajoling won
out. Our contents page mirrors the efforts and results of our
loyal authors.</p>

<p>I have learned, also, that the process of modifying the
language will take longer than we had anticipated. The MDC wants
to make certain that this important step -- modification -- is "done
right the first time," and this means more meetings, more draft
documents, and a natural vendor reluctance to proceed immediately
to implementation when modification proposals are still being
fine-tuned.</p>

<p>In any event, we did get this issue put together, with a rich
variety of topics bearing on internationalization. It is a
tribute to the M community that this "second-half" effort paid
off. I thank, in particular, Winfried Gerum, Dirk Steenken,
Paulo Roberto Baratta, and Ichiro Wakai for their burning of the
midnight oil, faxing, phoning, and thereby submitting their
articles in record time. We are of course also very grateful to
other authors whose contributions add to the technical content
of this issue: Aviva Furman and Thomas Munnecke have written a
stimulating article on usability testing; Dayna Aronson and
Dick Landis contributed an article on networking models; and
David Schulz has brought us up-to-date on the networking
environment in a financial setting. The resulting tapestry of
global viewpoints and stories on using and testing M
effectively introduces the richness of international activities.
These articles will help usher in the reality that the Gartner
Group forecasted just this past summer.</p>

<p>You may notice something new about our journal: the name has
changed, and, reflecting the new format and contents, we are
starting with a new volume series, beginning with volume 1,
number 1 for this issue. This step is a direct expression of our
confidence in the solid quality of the journal as it now
appears.</p>

<p>The process of putting together a journal, as they say, has
been a learning experience. Through my share of phoning and
faxing, I learned that it takes consistency, constancy, and
persistence to keep a quality product on track and on time. Now a
wiser editor, I am approaching the second issue with more of a
head start than the first. I am once again aware of how cooperative
this community is when the need exists. We have said that
we are looking for new material and new authors as we continue
on our road to excellence so ably initiated by the work of Ruth
Dayhoff, M.D., and Thomas Salander. At the same time, I extend
thanks to each author for your contributions to date, and know
that we will be looking for more of the same substance in the
future.</p>

<p>Let us hear from you.</p>
