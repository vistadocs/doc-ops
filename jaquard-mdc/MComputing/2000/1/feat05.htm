<h2>An Interview with Ray Newman on &quot;MUMPS VI&quot;</h2>

<p>For the past year, the newsgroup comp.lang.mumps has been
hearing about MUMPS V1, a new version of MUMPS written in
Australia.  The editor finally got around to interviewing Ray
Newman, the prime mover behind the new implementation:</p>

<p>MC:  Why write a new version of MUMPS?<br>
RN:  I got tired of being ripped off - for what MUMPS cost me
(approx $150k) I could buy approx 300 DSM user licences. Now, I
don't have to buy "per bum" licences.</p>

<p>MC:  What resources went into developing MUMPS V1?<br>
RN:  Four programers for about twelve months, plus two programers
for a few more months (I generally round it to about 50 man
months or $150k).</p>

<p>MC:  What development is still being done?<br>
RN:  We are still fixing the more obscure bugs.  I spend about a
third of my time on MUMPS V1 and another of our programers, about
25% of his time.  There is a long "to do" list which we are
slowly working our way through.  We swapped our main system over
from DSM to MUMPS six weeks ago - this found a couple of bugs and
will find more.</p>

<p>We now have, besides our main system, 14 small systems (5 to
10 jobs), one medium system (20 to 40 jobs) and mumps.org
installed and running well.</p>

<p>MC:  What development is planned?<br>
RN:  All sorts of things (besides bug fixes) - the following are
representive of the things on the "to do" list (not in any
order):</p>

<UL>
  <LI>Improve the <u>routineref</u> to conform to the standard.</LI><br>
  <LI>Port to linux and to the alpha (both Linux and FreeBSD).</LI><br>
  <LI>Make the multi-volume code work.</LI><br>
  <LI>Do more usefull things with unix signals.</LI><br>
  <LI>See if we can provide a method of manipulating the "processname".</LI><br>
  <LI>It would be nice to connect to user written xcalls.</LI><br>
  <LI>On-line data compressor.</LI><br>
  <LI>Need to add WRITE (or READ) /format and a USE to specify dev type.</LI><br>
  <LI>Look at implementing DDP.</LI><br>
  <LI>etc etc etc.</LI>
</UL>

<p>MC:  What web capability does MUMPS V1 have?<br>
RN:  Quite good, that was an important design aim.  The <a 
href="http://www.mumps.org">mumps.org</a> web site is entirely
written in MUMPS.</P>

<p>MC:  Do you intend to port MUMPS V1 to Microsoft Operating systems?<br>
RN:  Currently NO - If we ever port it to "pay me" operating
systems, it won't be free!</p>

<p>MC:  How did you come up with the name "MUMPS V1"?<br>
RN:  I couldn't think of a better one.  The first MUMPS I used
was called MUMPS V4B - a nice simple name.</p>

<p>MC:  How fast is MUMPS V1?<br>
RN:  We haven't done any specific benchmarks, but we do know that
MUMPS on a 450 MH Pentium III is a huge amount faster than DSM on
a poor old VAX 4000/60.</p>

<p>MC:  How close to the MUMPS standard is MUMPS V1?<br>
RN:  Fairly close - see http://www.mumps.org for details.</p>

<p>MC:  Are there any plans to port VistA to MUMPS V1?<br>
RN:  Yes - we are trying to set that up now, see <a 
href="http://www.hardhats.org/">The Hardhats web site</a> for
more information.</p>
