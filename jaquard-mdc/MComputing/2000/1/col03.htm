<h3>by Kate Schell</h3>

<P>Welcome to the first issue of M Computing to appear exclusively on the Worldwide web.  
It has taken some time to get this issue together, and I’d like to apologize for the amount
of time that has elapsed.  Life, Y2K, and the loss of the MTA staff all contributed to 
the delay.</P>

<P>The articles in this issue are an interesting mix, with the common theme of the 
&quot;front end&quot;, or data presentation layer:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Max Rivers writing about the development of the MTA web portal.</LI>
<LI>Michael Kholin writing about the use of Delphi with M.</LI>
<LI>Harm Kirchoff writing about selection of MWAPI over VB.</LI></UL>

<P>Some of the more appealing parts of M Computing are nothing but stubs in this issue.  
Since the MTA staff was laid off, nobody has come forward to help collect information 
for &quot;M Around the World&quot; or &quot;Industry in the News&quot;.  Don Piccone was 
the author of the &quot;MDC Briefs&quot;; he’s gone, and so is the column.  There aren’t 
any advertisements, any profiles of MDC Distinguished members, or any forms for transacting 
MTA business, such as becoming a member or purchasing publications.  I’m hoping that those 
things will be added in time.  If you have time to help, please let me know.  We are also 
looking for people who can help bring previous issues of M Computing into machine-readable 
format for publication on the web.</P>

<P>I know that there are some people who are less than thrilled at M Computing’s move to 
web format.  Plenty of people have told me that they want to be able to read it on the 
train, or the plane, without having to carry around a laptop.  I’m afraid that for now, 
you’ll just have to resort to local printing.  If there’s somebody out there who feels 
passionate enough about the hard copy issue to be willing to endow an MTA printing 
&amp; postage fund, we’d like to hear from you.</P>

<P>Wow!  We’re on the web.  I knew that we could do it, I just didn’t realize how long it would 
take.  I’ve been working towards this moment for two years, that is, ever since I took 
over as Executive Editor.</P>

<P>The internet is an awesome medium.  It is also a fairly uncontrolled medium.  
&quot;Information&quot; ranges from AA (Alcoholics anonymous, and the AA college football 
division) to Kawasaki’s ZZ series cycles.  In between there’s everything from medical 
advice, to sexy photos, from technical support to bigotry in all of its diverse forms. 
Where else could you find material that celebrates Hippocrates only as a mathematician 
and not as a physician?  The information was great, just incomplete.  Try to explain 
point of view and reliability of sources to a ten-year-old.</P>

<P>I hope you will look to M Computing for interesting and authoritative information on M.  
Articles in this journal are reviewed for accuracy and for potential appeal to our readers.
  Authors of columns are recognized experts in the field, or officers of the MTA. 
(Their columns, however, represent their own opinions.)</P>
