<h2>New MUMPS</h2>
<h3>by Winfried Gerum</h3>

<P>As InterSystems has acquired all major MUMPS implementations
to turn them into CASH (or Cach&eacute; or Kashe?) the need for
MUMPS User Groups (!) seemed to fade away.</P>

<P>But after FreeMUMPS for Linux (freem.vmth.ucdavis.edu) one
more new MUMPS Implementation for FreeBSD named simply MUMPS V1.0
can be downloaded from <A 
HREF="http://www.mumps.org/">www.mumps.org</A>.  MUMPS from
mumps.org is free, but not Open Source. mumps.org has admitted
that they have used code from FreeMUMPS. Producing a MUMPS
implementation is easy these days. So it seems that we can expect
even more MUMPS implementations in the future.</P>

<P>These free products cannot be bought by a would be monopolist.
And as -so far- there is no commercial support for these
products, a User Group becomes a necessity again.</P>

<P>Does anyone have experience with these free MUMPS products?
How easy is the migration,  what are the shortcomings? ...there
is a time to write...</P>
