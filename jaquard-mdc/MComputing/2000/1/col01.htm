<h2>From the Chairman<br>
Letter from the Chair</h2>

<P>Welcome to the first of what we hope to be many Web versions
of M Computing.  We must give our heartfelt thanks to Kate Schell
who has worked diligently to get this to the press (actually the
web).  Her patience in dealing with procrastinators such as me is
amazing.</P>

<P>The MTA remains alive, but is struggling.  The old MTA web
site <A HREF="http://www.mtechnology.org/">www.mtechnology.org</A>
was inadvertently shut down
for a number of days.  It is back up and now points to the new
MTA web site that Max Rivers, Art Smith and Ed de Moel have been
constructing despite a disappointing lack of volunteers.  The
September MTA meeting in San Diego produced a large number of
&quot;volunteers&quot; who signed up to help us create the new
web site.  Unfortunately, very few of those who signed up were
able or willing to produce.  I am reminded of the story of the
Little Red Hen!</P>

<P>For those of you who will be attending the InterSystems
Developer’s Conference in Orlando in March, the MTA will have a
table area that will demo the new web site.  Max Rivers will be
there to show and tell and to elicit your support and programming
talents for the future development of the site.  </P>

<P>Rather than describe what is on the new M web site and what
will be there, click on the M Portal Tour at <A 
HREF="http://www.mtechnology.org/">the MTA web site</A> and see
for yourself.  Better yet, volunteer to help develop part of the
system.</P>

<P>An MTA subcommittee chaired by John Covin has met to
restructure the membership and dues for the MTA.  With the new
virtual organization structure, there will be a number of changes
in how the MTA will be providing you with new ways to communicate
with your fellow M programmers, tutorials to be given and a
number of on-line learning experiences.  A dues restructuring
will be an integral part of these changes.</P>

<P>We are looking for one or possibly two people to replace Kate
Schell as the Editor of M Computing.  This is a challenging and
time-consuming task.  Kate has done a marvelous job and deserves
the opportunity to take a break after many months of effort. 
Dave Holbrook is eagerly seeking her replacement.  His e-mail
address is 
<a href="mailto:david.a.holbrook@cpmx.saic.com">david.a.holbrook@cpmx.saic.com</A>.</P>

<P>We will be holding elections for MTA Board of Directors
members.  Art Smith is chairing the nominating committee.  If you
would like to run for the board or you would like to nominate
someone for a board position, please contact Art.  His e-mail
address is <A HREF="mailto:SmithAB@missouri.edu">SmithAB@missouri.edu</A>.</P>

<P>The transition to the management firm of Stokes and Company is
now complete.  I’m sure there will still be some glitches while
their personnel learn who to contact about what.  All in all, it
has been relatively atraumatic.  Konnie Hooton is our primary
contact at Stokes.  She can be reached at (202) 289-4700 or <A 
HREF="mailto:konnie@stokespc.com">konnie@stokespc.com</A>.</P>

<P>The transition to a management firm has been a success
financially.  We are now operating on a break-even basis with
almost $100,000 in our bank account.  We may not be rich, but we
are solvent.  Now what the MTA needs most is for a whole bunch of
you to step forward to make the new MTA web site a dynamic focus
for the M community.</P>
