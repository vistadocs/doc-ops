<p>There weren't any submissions for this department.  Since we
are now an &quot;all volunteer&quot; organization, it is up to
our members and readers to determine the utility of this
section.</p>

<p>&quot;M Around the World&quot; needs a volunteer editor, and
international organizations who submit announcements, if it is to
continue to exist.  If you have a few hours that you could devote
to soliciting, compiling and formatting information, please
volunteer! Contact the <a href="mailto:konnie@stokespc.com">MTA
office</a> or <a href="mailto:david.a.holbrook@saic.com">Dave
Holbrook</a> of the MTA Board of Directors.</p>
