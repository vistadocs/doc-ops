<h2>MTA Comes Full Circle</h2>
<h3>by Max Rivers</h3>

<P>I remember my first visit to a users' group meeting. I had
just bought my first computer, a Mac S. E., and then attended a
Boston Computer Society Meeting. There were several hundred
people there. Well, not people exactly, they were mostly computer
programmers. I found out these amateur experts were willing
answer any and all of my questions, give me free software, and
more importantly, create a place for me to talk about my new
Macintosh.</P>

<P>A few years latter I attended my first MUMPS Users Group. Over
a thousand people attended the conferences and I walked around
like a kid in a candy store. Once again I had that amazing
experience of getting all my questions answered, of having my bag
filled to overflowing with diskettes of free software and of
having spent the better part of a week in the company of computer
programmers who believed as I did, that MUMPS was the end all of
computer programming languages.</P>

<P>Time brings about change, some making things better. MUMPS
became M, and then Cach&eacute;&reg;. Our old PDPs first were
replaced with VAX's and then with those ubiquitous PCs that sit
under our desks these days and have more computing power than
NASA did for the first moon shot. MUG (the MUMPS Users Group)
became the MTA (M Technology Association) with a staff of over a
dozen and conferences combined with the big guys.</P>

<P>Sometimes those changes are not for the better. Our membership
has declined from over 2000 to just over 450 this year. The MTA
responded to the decline in attendance and membership by going
back to our original mission to be a user group run by
volunteers.</P>

<P>Times have indeed changed. One-programmer shops have become
multi-layered IM departments. It's no longer enough just knowing
MUMPS. These days, to write an "M" application, you may need to
know SQL, ODBC, HTML, JavaScript, maybe some Java, TCP/IP, how to
run a web server, what CGI is, and on and on.<B> Now more than
ever, we MUMPS programmers need a user group to support us.</b></P>

<h2>The Rising Phoenix</h2>

<P>To facilitate this change we decided to create a Web Portal,
programmed in <B>WebLink</B>&reg; and <B>Cach&eacute;</B>&reg;
(along with HTML, JavaScript, etc.)-- to replace the costly
activities that we could no longer afford. In San Diego, it was
surprisingly easy to get people to sign up to volunteer to
participate in this new structure. In the months since, however,
it has not been as easy to get busy programmers to actually find
the time to do the would that's needed to create that portal.</P>

<P>Although we had over 25 people sign up for our Cach&eacute;
WebLink user group, none of them actually knew WebLink. They were
signing up to learn WebLink. Although this is a perfectly good
use of the site, the question remains,<B> how do we get the
portal programmed in the meantime?</b></P>

<P>The answer is the same as it has always been, for volunteer
organizations: <B>Volunteer</b>.</P>

<h2>What we have accomplished so far:</h2>

<P>The first obstacle was to find an ISP which offered
Cach&eacute; WebLink as its common gateway interface (CGI).
Innocently, I called up InterSystems and asked for their "list"
of ISP's offering Cach&eacute; WebLink. I figured, that I would
select the ISP closest to my home, and use them. Rude awakening.
InterSystems knew of no ISP's offering Cach&eacute; WebLink. To
make a long story short, I realized that if the MTA wanted a
WebLink ISP, we would have to become one ourselves. I found an
adventurous start-up ISP near my home, who was willing to put my
computer on his T1 line, as an experiment to see how well WebLink
worked. We're currently still running on my little 233 NT
machine, but expect to be moved to his real NT server any week
now.</P>

<P>The next step was to create a prototype of the portal, so that
all of you can see it, make suggestions and be involved. Even
though he does not program in Cach&eacute; WebLink, once a week
<B>David Whitten</B> and I have a phone conference call where I
describe the work I've done on the prototype. He makes
suggestions, and we agree on the programming tasks that the other
programmers and I will do in the following week. One of his
suggestions was to make available to all of you, the M community,
a detailed description of what it took to create the M portal web
site in Cach&eacute; WebLink. To that end, each programmer on the
project, keeps a weekly log, which we publish on the web,
describing the work we've done this week. In that way, you can
follow the process week by week (adding your own two cents either
through e-mail or on the form provided), or come in at the end
and read the history of the whole project.</P>

<P>You can visit the prototype by going to our website <A 
HREF="http://www.MTechnology.org/">www.MTechnology.org</a> and
click on "M Portal Tour."</P>

<P>So far, we have converted in the old MTA FileManager Member,
Mailing and "M Sources" databases into a Cach&eacute; WebLink
database which is now up on the portal. You can type in anyone's
name, Co., zip code, or the E-mail address, and see all the
matches from our 10,000 + M company database. Shortly, the same
functionality, will enable you to manage your own "Members page",
to keep your own information up-to-date, enter your own
preferences, and register for services. (As in the past, members
who wish to keep their information private can click on a "Do Not
Publish" checkbox, and their information won’t be available to
the public.</P>

<P>The other two avenues we have working, are the <B>online
tutorial section</B>, and the <B>searchable knowledge base</B>.
We’ve converted a public domain MUMPS learning system, originally
written in MUMPS into Cach&eacute; WebLink application. This is
an amazing piece of software, it's actually way I originally
learned to program in MUMPS 15 years ago. Employers will be able
to train employees using this system. Our next project will be to
write a tutorial-giver, so that people who gave tutorials, or
would like to give tutorials in future conferences, will be able
to give them on-line. Later versions will involve audio and live
video as well.</P>

<P>We also have a functioning, searchable Knowledge-base. It is a
place like comp.lang.mumps where you can ask, answer or comment
on MUMPS topics. The difference is that the MTA's Knowledge-base
is hierarchical, divided into topics and organized into
discussions. You can either use the search function to find
anything you are looking for, or you can set your Member's Page
up to have the system tell you when your question has been
answered. In the near future the portal will be able to email you
if you request "Push technology", or the next time you sign on to
the portal, you'll see a list of all the questions you answered,
asked, or commented on, or marked as being of interest to you to.
All new entries will be listed as hypertext links on your
Personal Portal page.</P>

<P>The same Push/Pull technology will be available for every
function of the MTA portal. You can ask for an alert:</P>

<UL>
<li>when new tutorials are scheduled, </li>
<li>when new software is made available in our software exchange, </li>
<li>when there is activity in a particular user area, </li>
<li>when a vendor schedules a demonstration, or makes free
software available, </li>
<li>or when we have one of our online shoot-outs: where two or
more companies demonstrate solving the same problem with their
respective products. </li></UL>

<P>In our job search area, you can store your criteria for a job
you might be interested in, and receive an alert whenever a job
is listed that matches your criteria.</P>

<P>"M Computing" will also be in the Knowledge-base, and
therefore searchable. Hopefully at some point, we'll find
volunteers willing to help put up past versions of "M Computing",
so that anything ever written in "M Computing" will be
accessible. For new articles, because the format of the MTA's
Knowledge-base is HTML, new articles will be able to include
graphics, RealAudio, and even real video.</P>

<P>The entire MTA directory is already upon the web, so "M
Sources" online will also be available. You will be able to keep
the information about your products, services, and self
up-to-date.</P>

<h2>What you can do to help:</h2>

<P>Even if you do not know Cach&eacute; WebLink, you can still go
to our web portal and find a whole page of suggestions about how
you can help, along with a form that you can fill out to
volunteer. Non-WebLink tasks include:</P>

<UL>
<li>There's lots of M. programming to be done including a
"SPAM" management system, automating the E-mail alert system, an
FTP system (for a uploading and downloading shareware) and
writing push and pull technology functions.</li>
<li>For those of you who are already doing too much MUMPS
programming during your day at work, there are plenty of other
tasks that we could use help with, including help with
graphics:</li>

<UL>
<li>creating animated gifts and banner ads,</li>
<li>logos and buttons,</li>
<li>help with page layout and other HTML and DHTML tasks,</li>
<li>help with video and audio presentations.</li></UL>
</UL>

<h2>What's in it for you?</h2>

<P>The simple answer is the same as it was way back when I bought
my first Macintosh SE;</P>

<UL>
<li>fast, free, real-world answers to your MUMPS questions, </li>
<li>a chance to learn new technologies as they emerge, </li>
<li>a chance to share what you've learned, and </li>
<li>a community of your peers.</li></UL>

<P>We have plans to put up a chat room on our web portal, so if
you slam up against one of those Technological walls, and don't
know where to turn, you can just logon to <A 
HREF="http://www.MTechnology.org/">www.MTechnology.org</a> and
see if an answer is available <B>right now </B>in our chat
room.</P>

<P>Or you can log your question into our Knowledge-base, and be
alerted when your answer arrives. Or you can use one of our
fee-for-services and ask one of the experts that we hope to have
registered with our system.</P>

<P>The MTA and the MTA portal are our attempt to respond to the
changing times by creating an automated user group which
hopefully will be even better than the "good old days Wanna
help?. Why don't you sign on see what we've done for you this
week?</P>
