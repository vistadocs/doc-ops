<h3>CyberTools Releases Version 15: Full Client Server for M and the Web</h3>

<p>CyberTools, Inc. is pleased to announce the release of Version
15 of the CyberTools development tools suite in October, 1999.
With Version 15, CyberTools expands its &quot;build-it-once&quot;
paradigm to include enhanced Java/web performance, while
maintaining compatibility with Microsoft Windows and telnet
environments.</p>

<p>CyberTools is the only full client/server solution for M and
the web, and Version 15 is a  high performance web solution for M
Technology. This high performance results from CyberTools'
delivery of all client/server transactions in a single IP packet:
CyberTools engineers around poor internet performance for faster
application responsiveness. Built in Java and fully integrated
with HTML, Version 15 avoids the web server latency in HTML
content requests common in pure HTML solutions.</p>

<p>CyberTools is a privately held Massachusetts corporation that
develops and licenses a technically rich cross-platform User
Interface Management System (UIMS), used by more than 1000
developers and hundreds of thousands of end-users worldwide.
CyberTools' &quot;build-it-once&quot; approach to Java/Web,
Microsoft Windows and telnet environments promotes easy
re-tooling and code re-use, and high integrity, mission-critical
performance.</p>

<h3>Acquisition of Georgetown University Library Information
System by CyberTools, Inc.</h3>

<p>Georgetown University Medical Center/Dahlgren Memorial Library
and CyberTools, Inc. are pleased to announce the acquisition of
the Georgetown University Medical Center Library Information
System (LIS) by CyberTools, Inc. in February, 1998. LIS has been
renamed "CyberTools for Libraries".</p>

<p>CyberTools is also pleased to announce that CyberTools for
Libraries is now shipping since its release in December, 1999.
Several former LIS sites have already completed installation; at
the same time, CyberTools for Libraries is also currently being
installed in new library customer sites, including the CareGroup
Healthcare System, a six-hospital network which includes Boston's
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, as well as in other
hospitals across the U.S.</p>

<p>One of the first integrated library information systems
tailored to meet the unique needs of medical libraries, it
features strategic strength in journals (serials) management as
well as in integration with the National Library of Medicine.
Mark Roux, President of CyberTools, states: &quot;CyberTools for
Libraries began as a fundamentally sound application with a
faithful customer base. CyberTools' expertise is in applying web,
GUI, and SQL technology to such applications. This acquisition is
a good fit between CyberTools and the library customer base: the
system is now a showcase web-GUI-client/server application, thus
allowing us to further penetrate the medical library market, as
well as to broaden the system's applicable market to include
other journal-based libraries. Since our founding in 1986,
CyberTools has built its business on long-term customer
relationships. We now aim to provide value to our library users
in response to their years of commitment to Georgetown
University's LIS.&quot;</p>

<h3>ESI Implements CORBA ORB</h3>

<P>ESI Technology Corp., Natick, MA. has been contracted by the
Veteran’s Administration to implement the CORBAmed specification
for the Clinical Observation Access Service (COAS). COAS
specifies the interfaces between a client and server for the
requesting of clinical observations. ESI has <B>implemented a
CORBA ORB along with a COAS Server</B> implementation which
handles COAS requests from CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture) clients. This result is an <B>open, standard
interface</B> in the VA’s VISTA System.</P>

<P>ESI
will be demonstrating this ORB connectivity and the VA/VISTA
CORBAMed implementation at the HIMSS Conference on April 9-12 in
Dallas, Texas. The EsiObjects<sup>TM</sup>
ORB communicates with client ORB’s (such as Iona’a OrbixWeb)
sending COAS requests. ESI will demonstrate how a <B>typical
legacy M system can be opened to</B> <B>modern CORBA
applications</B>. For more information about CORBA, Object
Oriented Programming, training or consulting services, please
