<h2>Article not yet Available</h2>

<p>The article you requested is not yet available in web-form.</p>

<p>The MTA is looking for volunteers to help making all articles
from M Computing available "on the web".</p>

<p>It is possible to use scanning techniques to make old articles
available, or to re-type the texts from the published journals.
We have learned that the scanning software is getting better at
every release, but is still not flawless. The effort of re-typing
an article would depend on the typing skills of the volunteer,
and we have learned the hard wat that the effort of correcting typos (scan-o's?)
in a scanned page takes only slightly less time than retyping...</p>

<p>If you are interested in volunteering to help making more articles
available on the web, please e-mail
