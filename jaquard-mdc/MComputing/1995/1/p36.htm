<h3>by Ed J.P.M. de Moel</h3>

<p>It is now several years ago that Thomas Salander started a
column in this magazine called <b><i>Stone Disks</i></b>.
Since then, a lot has happened, the magazine got a new name,
the column started to appear less regularly, and now the MDC even
has a new Chair. </p>

<p>As the new Chair of the MDC, I would like to pick up the
tradition that Thomas started, and write a column about the work
of the MDC for this magazine. Just to show my heritage (I'm from
The Netherlands), I'll change the title of the column into
<b><i>Windmills</i></b>. Before steam or oil powered engines were
invented, windmills were used to power machines for all kinds of
industrial activities. As such, I hope this title will signify
that MDC keeps M[UMPS] in motion.</p>


<p>For those of you who don't know me: in 1976 I was a student
majoring in physics and computer science at the University of
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and had a part-time job at the
Department of Medical Informatics at 'the other' university in
the same city. It was at that department that I got exposed to
this new language, and it didn't last long before I started to
become interested in the formalities of defining a computer
language. In 1980 I attended my first meeting of MDCC-E (MUMPS
Development Co-ordinating Committee of Europe). I stayed with the
Medical Informatics department for almost 11 years, developing
software to support all kinds of medical research, supporting
classes in programming and the use of programming tools in
Pascal, FORTRAN and MUMPS. During this period, I also wrote a
couple of text-processors. One in assembly that ran on the
university mainframe computer, one in MUMPS that ran on a PDP-11,
and was a lot easier to maintain. There was a third one, written
in FORTRAN, that didn't process familiar text, but
Middle-Egyptian hieroglyphs (<img src="glyph.gif" align=bottom>).</p>

<p>In 1987, I left the medical world
for a couple of years to work at the Department of Physics in
Utrecht (The Netherlands) to work there as a system-manager and
graphics specialist. Since 1990, I have been working in San Diego
(with SAIC) on the CHCS project. On this project, I was the main
architect of the Archive sub-system, and currently I am working
on the tools for performance monitoring.</p>

<p>But, back to the MDC. I attended my first MDC meeting in 1986,
and haven't missed a single one since then. There have been
meetings at which I noticed that more than half of the text in
the mailings for those meetings were (co)authored by me. I have
chaired many task-groups in MDC, and I have been the secretary of
one of the subcommittees for quite some time. Over the last
years, several articles by me were published in this magazine.
Last January, I was elected Vice-Chair, and last November, I
became Chair.</p>

<p>Let me just say that I feel very much honored to be the first
"foreigner" to Chair the MDC. From my participation in the MDC, I
have known for years that internationalization is daily practice
in this committee and that MDC is committed to involve people
from all around the world in their work, but now this has become
explicit for everyone to see.</p>

<p>But, back to the MDC. A lot has happened over the last year.
Five (!) draft standards were submitted for <i>canvass</i>, and
many new proposals reached <i>MDC Type A</i> status.</p>

<p>As to the canvass, two draft standards passed without
objections (GKS Binding and X-Window System Binding). There were 5
objections in all to the remaining three draft standards (M[UMPS]
Language Specification, Open M[UMPS] Interconnect and M[UMPS]
Windowing Application Programmer's Interface).</p>

<p>The MDC is currently in the process of addressing these
objections. If these objections can be resolved, the whole slew
of new standards can be published. If not, a re-canvass for the
remaining three documents may be necessary. Depending on the
deadlines for material to be included in this magazine, the
actual objections to the canvass, draft responses and further
pertinent information will appear in this or one of the two
following issues of M-Computing.</p>

<p>While I'm on the subject, I would like to mention one of the
most frustrating aspects of working on any standard: the time it
takes to see a proposal become reality. The goals of any
standards organization are many-fold, but include at least:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>produce a 'perfect' document</li>
<li>produce a document that pleases all users</li>
<li>include all 'great ideas'</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Unfortunately, these goals are at odds with one another: while
one group of people is wordsmithing a piece of text to make it
perfect and un-ambiguous, another group introduces a new 'great
idea' that renders the work of the first group worthless. If a
standards body would attempt to produce a document that contains
'all conceivable great ideas', they can never produce anything:
there is always another 'great idea'. As a result, a standards
body has to work with deadlines. Work that is ready by the
deadline can go into the 'current' submission of a standard; new
'great ideas' will have to wait for the next iteration. Very
practical, but also very frustrating for those of us who are
anxious to see their 'great idea' incorporated in a standard.</p>

<p>I mention this frustrating aspect of producing standards,
because two of the objections fall in this category: these
objectors feel that something is important enough for them that
they do not wish to wait for the next standard (that would most
probably not be before 2001). One of these ideas is completely
new, and the other is currently at "Type B" level. If we postpone
action on the documents that are currently "in canvass" until
work on these ideas is complete, it may be one or two years
before a new canvass can be conducted. Of course, by that
print-date, there will be new material that is important enough
that other people will not want to wait for its inclusion...</p>

<p>While it may be frustrating to see that it takes so long
before certain issues are perfected to the point that they
actually appear in a standard, in the M[UMPS] world, we are very
fortunate to see that most implementors do implement extensions
to the language shortly after they reach "MDC Type A" level. This
is why the MDC does not feel that the industry is harmed by
postponing the inclusion of an extension to the next iteration of
a standard.</p>

<p>But, enough about the canvass of the current draft standard,
let's have a look at the latest and greatest.</p>


<h3>Multiple patatoms within alternation</h3>

<p>Have you ever used the pattern match operator for anything
more complex than <tt>IF X?.E1C.E</tt> to see if a string
contains a control character? Well, it will be possible to
check</p>

<p><center><tt>IF X?1.3N.4(3A,2N,1A1P1N)...</tt></center></p>

<p>If the value of X starts with between 1 and 3
digits, followed by up to four occurrences of
either 3 alphabetics or 2 digits or 1 alphabetic, 1
punctuation and 1 digit), followed by...</p>

<p>The sequence within the parentheses is a list of
possibilities. When one of the possibilities occurs, the pattern
is matched.</p>

<h3>Portable string length</h3>

<p>This has been a very contentious proposal within the MDC. At
every stage, there were two major objections: one group of people
felt that the new number of characters was too low, while another
group of people felt that the new number of characters was too
high. The proposal has been modified to be all sorts of numbers
(4096, 2040, 1000, and many more). The new value that was
accepted for a portable string length is 512. The portable length
for subscripts, however, was not changed.</p>

<p>Portable, in this context, means for a programmer that one can
count on a program to run without any problems, as long as this
limit is not exceeded.</p>

<p>For a builder of a M[UMPS] language processor, portable means
that at least the number of this limit has to be supported.</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>M[UMPS] comes with a large number of built-in (intrinsic)
functions. No matter how large the number of provided functions
is, there is always a desire to add more. The capability to
include libraries to a M[UMPS] system will address this need. The
proposals that became MDC Type A during the last meeting define
the general concept of a library, and the administrative
specifics of how to define what is in a library. At the very next
meeting  the MDC will already be voting on several groups of
actual library functions to be included in the structure that is
currently still empty.</p>

<h3>Error code numbers</h3>

<p>Ever since the introduction of standardized error trapping,
new additions have been made to the list of standardized error
codes on a regular basis. At the last meeting, the code for the
error that occurs when the maximum string length is exceeded was
defined. Elsewhere in this magazine will be the complete table of
currently defined error codes.</p>

<h3>Appeals Process</h3>

<p>The activities of the MDC may have a large impact on
individual organizations. Like any organization that may have
such an impact, MDC has defined an appeals process. If ever you
are in a situation where you feel there is a need to invoke such
a procedure, please contact the MTA Secretariat for details.</p>
