<h2>The Annotated M[UMPS] Standards</h2>

<p>The 2005 edition of Ed de Moel's book 
<a target="new" href="../Demo/AnnoStd.html">The
Annotated M[UMPS] Standards</a> is
available on-line in interactive format.</p>

<p>The Annotated M[UMPS] Standards contains an updated version
of Ed's older book M[UMPS] by Example. In the newer version,
each example is hyperlinked with the corresponding sections of
the various M[UMPS] standards. All M[UMPS] standards are included
in this new book, the 1977, 1984, 1990 and 1995 versions,
as well as the draft MDC version. This book contains the language
standards as well as the various versions of Open M[UMPS] Interconnect,
the Bindings to GKS and X-Window<sup>TM</sup> and
the M[UMPS] Windows Application Programmers' Interface.</p>

<h2>M[UMPS] by Example</h2>
<h3><font color="#ff0000">Both the printed books and the CD-ROMs
are now sold out...</font></h3>

<p>The examples are still on-line. The easiest way to get there is from the
<a target="_blank" href="../Demo/AnnoStd.html">Annotated Standards</a> pages.<br/>
Click on the above link to start, that link gives access to all the on-line standards.
For many pages in the standards, there is a button labeled "examples" that leads to the examples for that part of the standard.</p>

<p>The old version of the "Examples" book is still available at:
<a href="../MDC/example/index.htm">http://71.174.62.16/MDC/example/index.htm</a>.
However, that version is no longer maintained.</p>
